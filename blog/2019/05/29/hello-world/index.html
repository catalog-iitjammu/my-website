associated with all courses, but the grade point/s might or might not be associated with the courses
depending on the category of the course.</p><p>3 CREDIT/S AND GRADE POINT/S</p><p>3.1 CECs and GPECs</p><p>3.1 Types of courses in M.Tech curriculum
In the M.Tech. curriculum, there are two following category of courses which are categorised in terms of
possibility of earning credits and grade points:</p><ol><li>Credit earning courses</li><li>Grade point earning courses
3.1.1 Credit earning course
A course from which a student will be able to earn credit/s only, but not the grade point/s, will be termed,
henceforth, as credit earning course (CEC). To earn credit/s from a CEC, a student has to complete the
course by successfully obtaining the satisfactory grade in that CEC, and by virtue of that, the student
will be able to earn the credit/s allotted with that CEC. In case the satisfactory grade is not obtained, it is
considered that the particular CEC is not completed by that student, i.e., the student needs to re-register
to the same CEC in future semesters. If the CEC is not an optional course and s/he needs to obtain the
satisfactory grade in that particular CEC, and then only the particular CEC will be completed by that
student.
3.1.2 Grade point earning course
A course will be termed as grade point earning course (GPEC) if a student can earn credit/s as well as
grade points from a course. To earn grade points from a GPEC, a student has to complete the course by
successfully obtaining the minimum passing grade in that particular course. In case the minimum passing
grade is not obtained, it is considered that the particular GPEC is not completed by that student, i.e., the
student needs to re-register to the same GPEC in future semesters if the GPEC is not an optional course
and s/he needs to obtain the minimum passing grade in that GPEC, and then only the particular GPEC
will be completed by that student. It is worth to notice that by completing, i.e., by obtaining the minimum
passing grade in a GPEC, the student will be able to earn the credit/s allotted with that particular GPEC
in addition of earning the grade points. How much grade points a student would be able to earn from a
GPEC depends on the performance of the student in that GPEC and what grade is assigned to the student
by the CC of the particular GPEC. Details of a grade and the associated grade points are described in
section 4.
3.2 Credit/s of a course: Definition</li><li>Different courses will be of different nature and might have different number of credit/s.</li><li>The number of credit/s associated with a course might be different depending on the number of
lecture/s or practical hours associated with that particular course.</li><li>Each credit of a course signifies that there will be 1 hr lecture per week, or 2 hrs of practicals or
laboratory/field training, seminar/project work etc. per week, and the course will be running for 14
weeks.</li><li>No credit is assigned for the directed studies or tutorial classes.</li></ol><p>3.2 Credit/s of a course</p><ol start="5"><li>In the case of CECs: In the case of CECs, there is a need to implement a suitable evaluation
mechanism. The CI/CC might use his/her own discretion to follow an evaluation mechanism suitable
for that particular CEC. It is strongly recommended that the mechanism to be followed for the
evaluation needs to be intimated to the students at the very beginning of the CEC.</li><li>In the case of GPECs: Additionally, it is also expected that 1 − 2 hrs of self-study beyond class
room study per week is required from every student to earn 1 credit from a GPEC.
Self-study, generally, means study by him/her-self, carrying out the assignments, solve exercise
numerical problems from text book and reference books/materials, do the course related project
work/s if any, and any other preparations which help the students to learn the subject matters better
and make them strong and confident.
Therefore, 2 credits in a lecture based GPEC indicates that there will be lectures of 2 hrs per week
and accordingly every student is strongly advised to provide additional 2 − 4 hrs in a week beyond
the class room study to understand the subject matters of that GPEC. Similarly, 2 credits in labo-
ratory based GPEC indicates that there will be 4 hrs practicals or laboratory training per week and
accordingly, 2 − 4 hrs in a week the student needs to devote to write the laboratory report and for
the self-study.
3.2.1 Significance of credits in the case of CECs:</li><li>Let us consider that z i is the credits associated with the i th CEC.</li><li>For example, if a student secures a satisfactory grade SS in a CEC of credit z i , s/he will earn z i
credits. By virtue of that, s/he will accumulate z i credits in the category of CECs.</li><li>Therefore, one can realise that in a CEC, a student can earn only credit/s which is/are associated
with that course, but can’t earn any grade point.</li><li>To earn credit/s, one has to secure satisfactory grade SS in a CEC.</li><li>In case the student receives unsatisfactory grade UU , s/he has to re-register for that course again in
the forthcoming semesters and secure satisfactory grade SS.</li><li>Let us also consider that the student has completed n number of such courses till date.</li><li>Therefore, the student has earned, till date, a total of Z =
n
i=1number of credits by virtue of
completing n number of CECs. This Z can also be termed as cumulative credits earned by the
student till date in the category of CECs.
3.2.2 Significance of credits in the case of GPECs:</li><li>Let us consider that c i is the credits associated with the i th course of such category.</li><li>Let us consider that g i is the grade point/s obtained by a student in the course under discussion.</li><li>Let us also consider that the student has completed p number of such courses till date.</li><li>Therefore, the student has earned, till date, a total of C = c i number of credits by virtue of</li></ol><p>i=1</p><p>completing p number of such courses. This C can also be termed as cumulative credits earned by
the student till date in the category of GPECs.</p><p>3.3 Grade and grade point/s of a course</p><p>3.3 Grade and grade point/s of a course: Definition</p><ol><li>The academic performance of a student in a GPEC, in which the student has registered, will be eval-
uated by the CC/CI. The measure of evaluation will be communicated, by the CC/CI, by assigning
various grades depending on the level of performance of the student in that GPEC.</li><li>Details of the grades and the associated grade points are available in section 4.</li></ol><p>3.4 Semester grade point average and cumulative grade point average
The semester grade point average (SGPA) and cumulative grade point average (CGPA) are the parameters
by which academic performance of a student in the GPECs is measured for a semester and across the
semesters, respectively.
3.4.1 SGPA: Determination procedure
In the case of GPECs, the academic performance of a student in a semester is measured by SGPA which
is determined as follows:</p><ol><li>Let us consider that a student, in a semester, has registered for r number of GPECs.</li><li>Let us consider that c i is/are the credits associated with the i th course of the category just mentioned
above.</li><li>Let us also consider that g i is/are the grade point/s obtained by the student in the i th course under
discussion.</li><li>Therefore, the SGPA of the student in that semester will be determined, after rounding off to two
decimal places, as follows:</li></ol><p>c i × g i (1)
r
c i
i=1</p><ol start="5"><li>In case, out of the r number of registered GPECs in a semester, the student passes/completes p (&lt; r)
number of courses, the SGPA of that student will be
c i × g i
c i
i=1
p
c i
i=1(2)</li></ol><p>because the grade point g i = 0 for (r − p) number of GPECs for which the student could not obtain the
minimum passing grade.
In that case, it is also going to be said that the student, in that particular semester, has received
(r − p) number of backlogs in the GPECs.</p><p>3 CREDIT/S AND GRADE POINT/S</p><p>3.5 M.Tech. degree requirements</p><p>3.4.2 CGPA: Determination procedure
In the case of GPECs, the academic performance of a student till date is measured by CGPA which is
determined as follows:</p><ol><li>Let us consider that c i is the credits associated with the i th GPEC.</li><li>Let us consider that g i is the grade point/s obtained by a student in the course under discussion.</li><li>Let us also consider that the student has completed p number of GPECs and there are b number
backlog GPECs till date.</li><li>Therefore, the academic performance of that student till date will be measured by CGPA where</li></ol><p>c i × g i
p+b
c i
i=1
p
p+b
c i
i=1</p><p>(3)</p><p>CGPA is a real number and will be rounded off to two decimal places for all future references.
It can also be noticed that the number of registered courses r till date can be more than the sum of
the p number of completed courses and the b number backlog courses, i.e., r ≥ (p + b), in case a
course has not been passed/completed in the 2 nd or subsequent attempt/s as well.
5. Determination of CGPA in the case of repetition of a course: In those cases, where a course
will be repeated/substituted by a student, the latest grade obtained by the student will replace the
previous grade and the CGPA will be determined on the basis of the latest grade obtained by the
student.
A student might repeat a course in case the student has failed in an institute core (IC) or department
core (DC) course or is intending to improve the grade in a course, as per the guidelines provided in
section 7.3.2, which s/he has already completed earlier. A student might also substitute a course as
per the guidelines provided in section 7.3.1.
6. In addition to the overall CGPA, the CGPAs for the course work and M.Tech. dissertation will also
be calculated separately. However, the CGPAs obtained for the course work and M.Tech. dissertation
will be used only for certain internal purposes, those will not be mentioned in the final transcript.
in addition, one needs to maintain a good moral character and adopt the best practices as per the laws
and constitution of India.
3.5 M.Tech. degree requirements
A student, taken admission to an M.Tech. programme, needs to complete all the following criteria to
obtain the M.Tech. degree:</p><ol><li><p>A student needs to earn adequate credits in GPECs as prescribed by the particular M.Tech. pro-
gramme.</p></li><li><p>A student needs to earn adequate credit/s in CECs if prescribed by the particular M.Tech. pro-
gramme.</p></li><li><p>CGPA course ≥ 6.00</p></li><li><p>CGPAdissertation ≥ 6.00</p></li><li><p>One should complete all the M.Tech. degree requirements within a time period as mentioned in
section 2.3.
It also needs to be noticed that the mere satisfaction of all the criteria mentioned above does not guarantee
an M.Tech. degree; in addition, one needs to maintain a good moral character and adopt the best practices
as per the laws and constitution of India.</p></li></ol><p>4 Grades of different nature and the associated grade points
To accommodate the two category of GPECs and CECs, two different nature of grades are to be assigned.
In the case of GPECs, various grades will carry different grade points depending on the performance of
a student in that course. For all the categories of courses, an uniform two letter grade convention will be
followed as listed in table 1.</p><p>Table 1: Grades and grade points in GPECs and CECs
GradesGrade Feature/sPerformance of the student</p><p>GPEC  CEC  3</p><p>AB 9 - Excellent
4 BB 8 - Very good
5 BC 7 - Good
6 CC 6 - Average
7 CD 5 - Below average
8 DD 4 - Sufficient to pass
9 FP 0 - Failing because of poor academic performance
10 FW 0 FW Y ≡ FP Failing because of withdrawal of course due to inadequate attendance
11 FN 0 FN YY ≡ FP Failing because not taking the end semester examination
12 SA - - Satisfactory in auditing a course
14 UU - - Unsatisfactory</p><p>The grade FP indicates that the student has failed in a GPEC due to poor academic performance and the
student has to repeat the course in future semester/s in case the course is not optional.
Y The grade FW indicates that the course is withdrawn beyond the allowable time limit and/or the
student did not maintain adequate attendance in that course during the semester. As a result, a failing
grade FW , which is equivalent to the grade FP , is assigned. Therefore, the student has to repeat the
course in future semester/s in case the course is not optional.
The grade FW can also be assigned in case of disciplinary actions against the academic malpractices.</p><p>5 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>YY The grade FN indicates that the student did not take the end semester examination and therefore, a
failing grade, which is also equivalent to the grade FP , is assigned which compels the student to
repeat the course all together in future semester/s in case the course is not optional. In case the
student could not able to take the end semester examination due to genuine reasons, the conduction
of make-up end semester examination will be permitted by the SPGB, as per the guidelines provided in
section 5.10, after receiving the formal request from the student and consequently, an appropriate
grade will be assigned without any penalty. The new appropriate grade will supersede the previously
assigned grade FN .
The grade WW indicates that the student has withdrawn the course during a specified time period. More
details can be obtained in section 6.5.2.</p><p>5 Examinations and assessments
Different assessment procedures are to be adopted depending on the nature of courses. General guidelines
are being provided in this section.
5.1 Evaluation modes of theoretical courses
A template of the evaluation scheme for the theoretical courses are provided in table 2. A part of the
template will strictly be adhered and the remaining part will be flexible one depending on the nature of
the course and the mutual agreement among the students, and the CI/s and/or CC.

8 Term project</p><ul><li>≤ 30 No</li></ul><p>5.1.1 Need of different mode of evaluation scheme
In case of requirement of implementing different mode of evaluation scheme for a course of specific
nature at PG level, the CC might propose a different evaluation scheme for such a course and take a prior
approval from the Dean (academics) before the commencement of the course.
5.1.2 Responsibility of the CI/CC to conduct the evaluations
Except the mid. and end semester examinations, all other evaluations will be conducted by the CI/CC at
regular intervals without disturbing the overall class schedule of the institute. Institute will schedule the
mid. and end semester examinations. The conduction of class tests 1 and 2 at two halves of the running
semester for a minimum duration 30 min for each of the tests is mandatory.</p><p>5 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>5.2 Lab courses</p><p>5.1.3 Mandatory requirement of taking the end semester examination to receive a passing grade in a GPEC
It is the mandatory requirement for a student to take the end semester examination to be eligible to
receive a passing grade in a GPEC. It does not matter what are the marks obtained by a student in all the
evaluations conducted during the in-semester course works.
Make-up end semester examination: In case a student could not take the end semester examination
due to genuine reasons, the student needs to apply, as mentioned in section 5.10, to the Dean (aca-
demics) with proper justification and submission of documentary evidences to receive the approval
to take the make-up end semester examination.
Make-up in-semester evaluations: For not taking any one of the in-semester evaluations including the
mid. semester examination, the CI/CC will decide whether to conduct the make-up examination or
not. The CI/CC is/are strongly advised to pre-announce the policy, at the beginning of the semester,
for make-up examination of the in-semester evaluations.
5.2 Evaluation modes of laboratory courses
An optional template, for the evaluation scheme of the laboratory courses, is suggested as follows:</p><ol><li>Weekly experiments: 6-12 no. of experiments Weightage: 30 − 60 %</li><li>Project assignment: Hands-on project experience in a group Weightage: 10 − 30 %</li><li>Mid. sem. evaluation: Skill test (One experiment to be performed) Weightage: 10 − 20 %</li><li>End sem. evaluation: Skill test (One experiment to be performed) Weightage: 10 − 20 %</li><li>End sem. viva voce and/or written test: Weightage: 10 − 30 %
5.3 Semester grade report
The SGPA of a semester is to be communicated to the concerned student through the semester grade
report (SGR).
5.3.1 SGR: List of contents
A SGR of a student for a particular semester will typically contain the following:</li><li>Name, entry number and department of the student</li><li>Brief semester details: Autumn/spring and latest semester level the student has completed along
with the date of display of grades</li><li>Details of all the earned and non-earned GPECs and CECs, the student has registered in that
semester with the following information for every course:
(a) Name and code number of the course
(b) Category of course: GPEC or CEC</li></ol><p>5 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>5.4 Transcript</p><p>18 of 48

5.4 Transcript
Transcript, generally to be issued to a student by the institute at the end of the completion of the M.Tech. programme, is a consolidated academic performance report of a student with the collection of information
compiled from all the SGRs.
An interim transcript can also be issued to a student at any time during the M.Tech. programme after
receiving a request from the student and payment of the applicable fee.
5.4.1 Additional contents of the transcript
A transcript to be issued by IIT Jammu will provide the following additional information:</p><ol><li>Though it is not intended to categorise the overall CGPA, obtained by an PG student who has been
awarded a M.Tech. degree from IIT Jammu, into the first, second and third divisions; it might be
necessary in future when such categorisation is required to be provided by IIT Jammu so that the
M.Tech. degree awardee of IIT Jammu can comply the criteria set by different external agencies and
make them eligible to apply for a job, submit an application or to satisfy any other requirements. For
the benefits of the students to deal with such situations, a conversion table 3 is provided which cor-
relates the CGPA and the first, second and third divisions. This conversion table 3 will be provided
at the reverse side of the transcript.
Table 3: Correlation between the overall CGPA and the first, second and third divisions</li></ol><p>Range of CGPA Divisions
CGPA ≥ 6.00 First
5.00 ≤ CGPA &lt; 6.00 Second
4.00 ≤ CGPA &lt; 5.00 Third</p><p>It is also to be noticed that the minimum CGPA requirement for an M.Tech. degree is 6.00 and
therefore, all the M.Tech. degree awardee of IIT Jammu can be categorised under first division.</p><p>5 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>5.5 Display of the answer booklets</p><ol start="2"><li>It is observed that when a student applies for a job or higher study in a foreign country, there is
a need to inform what is the medium of instructions in the PG engineering programme. To satisfy
such requirement, it would be mentioned, that the medium of instructions in IIT Jammu is English,
at the reverse side of the transcript to be issued by IIT Jammu.
5.5 Display of the evaluated answer booklets
It is the responsibility of the students to verify the answer booklets after being evaluated by the CI/s
or CC. One should make him/her-self convenient to be present when the answer booklets would be
displayed by the CI/s or CC at a pre-announced place, date and time.</li><li>All in-semester and end-semester evaluated answer booklets will be shown to the students before
submitting the grades.</li><li>Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC:
(a) It should be the practice to display the evaluated answer booklets of the mid. and end semester
examinations within 3 − 4 days from the last date of respective examinations.
(b) All in-semester evaluations should be completed and shown to the students well before the
commencement of the end semester examination.</li><li>Advisory to the students:
(a) Students are advised to be in the IIT campus up to the last date of grade submission.
(b) They should remain prepared to re-check the evaluated answer booklets upon receiving an
email announcement by the CI/s or CC with two-hour notice period.
5.6 Disclosing of the total marks and grades
Depending on the total marks obtained by a student in a course, an appropriate grade will be assigned
at the sole discretion of the CC. In general, the following procedure will be adopted to submit the final
grades:</li><li>Total marks along with all the break-ups and the respective weightages are to be made available by
the CC on or before the penultimate day of the last date of grade submission so that the students can
inform the CC in case of any modifications required.</li><li>Last date of grade submission will typically be 3 − 4 days after the last date of end semester exam-
ination.</li><li>Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC:
(a) All CCs should submit the grades to the academic office on or before the last date of the grade
submission.
(b) There should be the practice that all the CIs, CCs and the Head of department will have a grade
moderation meeting together on the following day of the grade submission date.
(c) The grade distributions and the grading scheme should be analysed to identify the need of
reduction of skewed grade distribution if any and suggest the modifications to the CC.</li></ol><p>5 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>5.7 Re-totalling</p><p>(d) In case, the CC is not present in the grade moderation meeting, the CI will take the decision
whether to modify the grades or not. In absence of both of the CC and CI, the Head of depart-
ment will be empowered to modify the grades if required.
(e) After the grade moderation meeting, the grades will be frozen and made available to the stu-
dents on the next day of the grade moderation meeting.
(f) In order to complete all the degree requirements to submit the grades by the date prescribed,
all the faculty members are requested not to avail any leave, unless very urgent, during this
period.
(g) In case of large number of answer booklets to be evaluated and date of the end semester exam-
ination at the end stage of the examination week, or any other unavoidable circumstances, one
has to take prior approval from the chairperson of the Senate, the Director, in order to extend
the date of grade submission.
4. A student would be able to see his/her grades on the following day of the grade moderation meeting
provided the student has submitted the course feedbacks on-line.
5.7 Request for re-totalling and/or the change of grade
A student has to make a request for re-totalling of the answer booklet of the end semester examination,
or the change of grade.</p><ol><li>Request for re-totalling and/or the change of grade is to be made by the students to the Dean (aca-
demics) within 15 days from the last date of grade submission.</li><li>After the qualification of the request, the re-totalling will be carried out by the CI/CC upon receiving
an instruction from the Dean (academics) and the grades will be changed by the CI/CC appropriately
with improved/reduced grade points if the needs be.</li><li>Request for change of grade only without the request for the re-totalling of the answer booklet
will receive due importance by the Dean (academics) once the hint/s of inconsistencies is/are being
depicted through documentary evidences provided by the student.
5.8 Retention of evaluated answer booklets
Considering that the re-evaluation of the answer booklets, if any, will be completed by one semester, the
following policy will be followed for the retention of the evaluated answer booklets:</li><li>The evaluated answer booklets will be retained for the next one semester by the CC.</li><li>In the absence of the CC, the CI will take care of the answer booklets.</li><li>In the absence of the CC and CI both, the department will take care of the answer booklets provided
those are handed over to the department by the CC/CI.
5.9 Attendance policy
Students are requested to attend all the classes. However, 75 % attendance is mandatory to pass a course.</li></ol><p>5 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>5.10 Make-up</p><p>5.9.1 Advisory to the all concerned to aim for active participation
The objective of the students should be to actively participate in the class with an intent to learn.
Kindly notice that an absence, in one lecture even, might develop technical as well as psychological dis-
comfort towards the course. Subsequently it might attract absence in the next lecture as well. Therefore,
do attend the lectures if not impossible.</p><ol><li>Students need to study at hostels during the off periods and remain up-to-date so to be confident to
ask questions in the lectures.</li><li>There should be mutual interactions so that the doubts can be cleared.</li><li>Clear the doubts latest by the next lecture and then, proceed further.
5.9.2 Policy to promote attendance and discourage absence
Low attendance in a single course: The following attendance policy might be followed:</li><li>To promote the attendance, mutually decided incentive scheme (for e.g., addition of 5 extra marks)
may be implemented for the students having attendance beyond a certain limit (for e.g., attendance
≥ 90 % or in similar range).</li><li>For the deterrence to loss of interests through absence in several lectures, if the attendance &lt; 75 %,
the course will considered to be withdrawn beyond the allowable time limit and/or the attendance
is inadequate. A grade FW or UU , as deemed appropriate, depending on the category of GPEC or
CEC respectively, will be assigned.</li><li>Surprise tests for short durations might be conducted frequently.</li><li>Any other attendance policy, the CI/s and/or CC might adopt in consultation with the students. Once
fixed, the policy should be documented and clearly be intimated to the students.
Low attendance in several courses: In case, a student receives grade FW in 4 or more GPECs in a
single semester without the valid reasons according to the discretion of the SPGB, the student will be
put on probation for a semester. In the semester under probation, if the student continues to receive
grades FW in 2 more GPECs, the student will lose the privilege of lodging and boarding in the hostel
accommodation provided by the institute.
5.9.3 Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC
Records of all lecture-wise attendance of the students should be maintained by the CI/s or CC and shared
with the students.
5.10 Make-up end semester examination
The make-up end semester examination will be conducted only if it is approved by the Dean (academics)
upon receiving the request for such from the student. The Dean (academics) is empowered by the Sen-
ate to decide whether the reasons for not taking the end semester examination are genuine or not, and
therefore, the decision taken by the Dean (academics) is final and binding to the all concerned.</li></ol><p>6 REGISTRATION</p><p>5.10.1 Eligibility for the make-up end semester examination
A student will be eligible for the make-up end semester examination if all of the following conditions
are satisfied:</p><ol><li>In case of severe personal health problems for the student, unavoidable family commitments or
any other valid reasons beyond the control of the student, the student has to apply, to the Dean
(academics) through proper channel within the maximum allowable time limit as prescribed by
the institute. The student needs to submit the necessary supporting documents which the Dean
(academics) can consider to be the enough documentary evidence in favour of the genuinity of the
reasons for not taking the end semester examination.
In case of absence in the end semester examination due to health problems, all the supporting doc-
uments need to be authenticated by the IIT hospital.
Rather than waiting for the grades to be displayed by the institute, such students are advised to
submit the application for the make-up end semester examination, as mentioned above, at the earliest
convenience.</li><li>The student has received a grade FN in case of a GPEC. In case of a CEC, the student needs to
maintain adequate attendance as expected by the concerned CI/CC.
If a grade FW is offered in case of a GPEC, the course will considered to be withdrawn because of
inadequate attendance and therefore, the student will not be eligible for the make-up end semester
examination.</li><li>The request of the student to take the make-up end semester examination needs to be approved by
the Dean (academics).</li></ol><p>5.10.2 Procedures to be followed to conduct the make-up end semester examination
The make-up end semester examination, after the approval from the Dean (academics), will be conducted
as per the following guidelines:</p><ol><li>The make-up end semester examination will be conducted before the commencement of the forth-
coming semester.</li><li>The CC/CI will set the question paper for the make-up end semester examination. The CC/CI might
conduct the make-up examination by him-/her-self or nominate a faculty member for its conduction.</li><li>Grades might be submitted by 2 − 3 days by the CC/CI after evaluating the original answer booklet.</li></ol><p>6 Registration
Registration is the mandatory pre-requisite for a student to be eligible to take courses in a semester.</p><p>6.1 Academic calendar</p><p>6.1 Academic calendar for the semesters
For any post-graduate students, there will be the following two semesters in a year and the tentative
academic calendar for the semesters is as follows:</p><ol><li>Autumn: July - December</li><li>Spring: January - June
6.2 Semester-wise registration
For the registration, one should know what are the courses to be running in that semester and which
courses the student needs to take.</li><li>It is the responsibility of the student to know the exact requirements and accordingly, one needs to
register.</li><li>Students are advised to consult the assigned PC before registering for the courses. There will be one
departmental PC for a batch of students of same year.</li><li>It is the responsibility of the students to approach their respective PC along with the SGRs so to get
advised by the PC appropriately.</li><li>It is the student who has to ensure that s/he have registered the courses as per the department and
institute specified norms.
(a) The student should know what are the mandatory courses one has to register and do the regis-
tration accordingly.
(b) The student should know what are the available options within which one has to register for
the optional courses and do the registration accordingly.
(c) The student should know what are the flexibilities available within the registration process and
select the courses accordingly so that the maximum and minimum allowable credit limits do
not get violated.
(d) It is the responsibility of the student to choose the courses which do not clash with the time-
table. The courses chosen with the time-table clash may result in the withdrawal of a course
and therefore, it might invite the associated consequences as referred in the section 4.
(e) A PG student can choose a maximum of two UG courses of level 2 nd year of higher during
entire PG programme after consultation with his/her programme advisor/supervisor as appro-
priate.
6.3 Procedure for registration
All the registration processes and subsequent modifications, if required, are generally needed to be
carried out through on-line.
Pre-requisites for the registration are as follows:</li><li>All institute, library, hostel and mess dues are to be cleared.</li><li>All course feedbacks of the previous semester are to be submitted on-line beforehand.</li></ol><p>6.4 Registration time line</p><p>6.4 Registration time line
Every student needs to register on-line at the beginning of the semester within the institute prescribed
time period to be mentioned in the academic calendar. Along with the on-line registration, the students
need to be physically present in the institute campus at-least before two days the classes start. In case
a student fails to report his/her physical presence within the time limit just mentioned above, the stu-
dent would be de-registered from the semester, i.e., on-line registration, if done, will be cancelled and
effectively, there will be a semester drop for that particular student.
6.5 Course adjustment during the semester
After the registration process and during the initial stage of the semester when the courses are running,
there is a provision to adjust the courses in case a student is not comfortable with the courses. The
following guidelines are to be followed for the course adjustment.
6.5.1 Addition of course/s during the semester</p><ol><li>A student can add/drop the courses within the institute prescribed time period which will typically
be within 2 weeks from the first date of the beginning of the classes. Any addition or deletion of
course/s during this time period will not be mentioned in the SGR/transcript.</li><li>All other conditions of the registration remain the same.
Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC
The following advisories are recommended to the CI/s and/or CC:</li><li>Should not take leave, within the maximum allowable time period for the course adjustment, unless
urgent.</li><li>Advised to compensate the classes, if any, within the time period itself so that students get enough
exposure to decide whether to continue or discontinue from the registered courses.</li><li>Advised to conduct one class test, of standard quality, during this time period.
6.5.2 Withdrawal of course/s during the semester</li><li>Maximum allowable time period for the course withdrawal will typically be 1 week after the mid.
semester examination. One needs to withdraw the course/s by this time.</li><li>In case of a withdrawl of a course beyond the last day of add/drop of a course and before the final
day of a course withdrawl, a grade WW will be assigned against the course.</li><li>No more course withdrawal will be possible beyond the time period just mentioned. Absence in
the classes without the course withdrawal within the allowable time limit will attract assigning a
grade FW or UU which is equivalent to the grade FP or UU depending on the GPECs or CECs,
respectively.</li></ol><p>6.6 Audit course</p><p>Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC
The CC is, therefore, strongly recommended to complete the evaluation of answer booklets of the mid.
semester examination and show those to the students by 4 days of the end of the mid. semester exam-
ination so that the students can take a decision whether to continue or withdraw the course within the
maximum allowable time period for the course withdrawal.
6.6 Audit course
Students might prefer to take additional courses, beyond the minimum requirements prescribed by the
institute, for several good reasons. They might also look for focusing on a certain, but significant, segment
of the course contents for the purpose of carrying out a project of interest with the help of the segmented
knowledge s/he wants to obtain from the course. Therefore, the student might also prefer not to put the
same amount of rigour for the rest of the course contents. To make the students eligible to go through
such course and have a formal recognition of such additional efforts, institute provides the provision
where a student might prefer to register for a course with an option of “audit” rather than registering the
course as the regular one.</p><ol><li>In a course the student has registered as audit, no credit as well as grade point can be obtained by
the student in that course.</li><li>Grade: A grade SA will be assigned to a student in case the performance of the student in that
course opted for audit is up to the level of satisfactory.</li><li>Advisory to the student: .
(a) The student needs to consult the CI/CC before registering for such course.</li><li>To make a student serious about the course opted for audit and also to avoid the possibility of
creating negative environment by such students, the student might be disallowed in the course by
the CI/CC at any time if the need be.
6.6.1 Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC
The following advisories are recommended to the CI/s and/or CC:</li><li>Should not take leave, within the maximum allowable time period for the course adjustment, unless
urgent.</li><li>Advised to compensate the classes, if any, within the time period itself so that students get enough
exposure to decide whether to continue or discontinue from the registered courses.</li><li>Advised to conduct at-least one class test, of standard quality, during this time period.
6.7 Minimum number of students required to run a particular course:
DE and IE/OE courses can run if the number of students registered in the course is equal or more than 5;
otherwise, the following will be adopted:</li></ol><p>7 IRREGULARITIES</p><ol><li>The course can run, however no teaching load will be counted for the CI/s and/or CC.</li><li>In order to count the teaching load for the CI/s and/or CC, an approval from the Dean (academics)
on recommendation from the DPGC is to be obtained in case running the course is indispensable
for the students registered in the course.
7 Irregularities in the M.Tech. programme
In order to provide an alternative to choose an appropriate career option, an early termination to academ-
ically non-performing students is recommended.
7.1 Termination of the M.Tech. programme:
An M.Tech. student might be terminated from the institute due to academic poor performance and other
reasons as well.

all examinations. Inability to show the identity card when requested by the invigilator may lead to
expulsion from the examination hall/room and thus, the cancellation of the examination.</li><li>Students are strongly advised not to carry any electronic gadgets, like mobile phones, tablets, laptops
and programmable calculators, etc., inside the academic block. All such items should be kept at the
hostel securely so that no body else can misuse those during the examination. In case of misuse
of electronic gadgets, the owner of the gadgets will be held responsible unless anybody else is
found/proven to be guilty. In case any such electronic gadgets are found in possession or in the
belongings of a student during the examination even if the gadget is found to be turned off, it might
attract severe punishments as prescribed by the rules of the institute.</li><li>During the examinations, any kind of exchange among the students is strictly prohibited. Therefore,
the students are strongly advised to carry all the necessary and acceptable materials by own selves.</li></ol><p>11 DETERRENCE AGAINST ACADEMIC MALPRACTICES</p><p>11.3 Procedures</p><ol start="4"><li>There should not be any scribblings on any part of the body, in any items used by the students or in
nearby furnitures and walls.</li><li>Any need of communication by a student should solely be addressed to the invigilators. Any other
communication in/out-side the examination hall/room or during the toilet break may attract disci-
plinary actions as per the rules of the institute.</li><li>It is the duty of the students to take permission from the invigilator to leave the examination
hall/room at the end of the examination and/or temporarily for any toilet break. If a student is found
to be outside the academic block while the examination is going on without the prior permission
from the invigilator, the examination of the student will be cancelled. In case a student completes an
examination before the stipulated time, the student should not get involved in any discussion before
the student leaves the academic block.</li><li>It is the duty of the students to ensure all fairness during the examinations. Any lapse, knowingly or
unknowingly, leading to academic malpractice might attract disciplinary actions.</li></ol><p>11.3 Flow of procedures and guidelines
After identifying any case of academic malpractice incurred by a student, the concerned invigilator must
convey the incident with a brief report (along with the seized document/s if any) to the academic office.
11.3.1 Guidelines for invigilators
In case it is observed that a student is using unauthorised materials like chits, lecture notes, books, phones,
answer papers of others, etc. during the examination, the invigilator should seize such items. In order to
confiscate the unauthorised materials from the students and keep the evidence of such malpractices,
invigilator might ask for help from the academic office when the needs be. The invigilator should seize
the answer booklet used by the student. The invigilator should issue a fresh booklet to the student so
that the student can resume writing the examination. A detailed report along with all the seized materials
should be submitted by the invigilator to the academic office. Both the answer booklets should also
be submitted to the academic office Answer booklets will be handed over to the CC/CI in case it is
recommended by the DPGC or ADC. However, both the answer booklets can be given to the CC/CI
temporarily after the examination is over by the academic office, but both the booklets are to be returned
to the academic office by the CC/CI within a prefixed time mutually agreed.
In case, it is observed by the invigilator that the students are involved in verbal communications, answer
booklets of the participating students can be seized or marked by the invigilator to draw the attention of
the evaluators and necessary actions by the CC/CIs. In case the answer booklets are seized, the incident
has to be reported to the academic office.
In case, a part of the body of a student is found with scribblings, the incident should be reported and
endorsed by all the invigilators. In case there is a single invigilator in the examination hall/room, help
from academic office can be taken for the witness and second endorsement along with the endorsement
from the invigilator.
It is to be noticed that the CC/CI when doing the invigilation duty for the same course s/he is teaching,
the CC/CI will also be called as the invigilator.</p><p>11 DETERRENCE AGAINST ACADEMIC MALPRACTICES</p><p>11.3 Procedures</p><p>Invigilators will, by default, consider lecture notes, books and any other similar items as unauthorised un-
less any particular materials have specifically been allowed by the CC/CI and informed to the invigilators
accordingly.
11.3.2 Guidelines for report preparation</p><ol><li>An act of malpractice during an examination is to be reported by the invigilator immediately, latest
within 24 hours.</li><li>Report must contain: Entry number, name of the student, course code and name.</li><li>Brief description of the event along with time and date</li><li>Collections of the evidence if any and submission of the same along with the report</li><li>Undertaking from the student if the student wants to appeal for leniency
11.3.3 Guidelines for the CC/CI
In case, a punishment is imposed to a student due to an act of academic malpractice, it should be reported
to the concerned student, the Head of the department of the student, the Head of the department offering
the course, Dean (academics) and the academic office.
The CC/CI, if wishes, might refer the case to the DPGC with specific recommendation.
11.3.4 Guidelines for the DPGC and /or the ADC</li><li>After receiving the report from the invigilator, the academic office will inform the CC/CI, DPGC or
ADC depending on the act of academic malpractice.</li><li>Date of meeting of DPGC/ADC: In case of academic malpractice during an examination and it is
reported to the DPGC/ADC, a meeting will be called on the following working day of the last date of
examination by the respective body. It is the duty of the concerned students and the representatives
to make themselves available for the meeting.</li><li>The concerned student along with the student representatives of the DPGC/SPGB will be invited in
the meeting.</li><li>In the case of DPGC, at-least 3 DPGC faculty members and in the case of ADC, five faculty mem-
bers of ADC are required to be present in the meeting to complete the quorum.</li><li>The CC/CI and the invigilator who submitted the complaint and the student against whom the com-
plaint was made will not be the part of the DPGC/ADC even if s/he happens to be a member of the
DUGC/ADC. In that case, another faculty member/student representative can be nominated by the
respective persons.</li><li>The recommendation of DPGC/ADC along with all the documents tabled during meeting will be
forwarded to the Dean (academics) for approval with a copy to all the faculty members involved in
the meeting.</li><li>The Dean (academics) may approve the recommendation, seek clarifications, or submit it to the
ADC/separate committee/Senate if a more stringent measure is warranted.</li></ol><p>11 DETERRENCE AGAINST ACADEMIC MALPRACTICES</p><p>11.4 Disciplinary corrections</p><p>The case is to be reported to the ADC to take it forward.</p><ol start="8"><li>After approval by the Dean (academics), the report is sent to the academic office for implementa-
tion. A letter is also issued to the student regarding the implementation of the disciplinary actions
with copies to the concerned CC/CI, invigilator, the parents of the student, the Head of the depart-
ment of the student, and the DPGC/ADC members. The office of Dean (academics) should file all
documents related to reported cases of academic malpractices. It is expected that the decision of the
DPGC/ADC should be intimated to the all concerned latest by one day before the last date of grade
submission.</li><li>The office of Dean (academics) will be responsible to identify the repeat offenders. On discovery
of a case of repeat offence, the relevant documents are forwarded to the ADC. A repeat offence
means that the student has already been found guilty of a similar offence earlier; it need not be in
the same course, or even in the same department. In this situation, Dean (academics) may involve
or invite one psychological expert from the institute to be an associated member of the ADC during
the entire procedure after considering the gravity of the case.
11.4 Disciplinary corrections
Depending on the severity of the act of academic malpractices, different corrective measures are recom-
mended.
11.4.1 Impersonation: Proxy in attendance/Leaving the class after giving attendance
Missing a class after marking attendance will lead to issue of warning letter to the student by the con-
cerned CC/CI. The second offence will lead to one grade penalty. Repeated offence beyond the second
time will lead to allotment of grade FW in that particular course.
In this case, the CC/CI is solely empowered to take the decision. The warning and punishments can be
conveyed by the CC/CI to the concerned student by an email notification with a copy to the batch of the
students.
11.4.2 Impersonation: Representation of a student during any evaluation
A student, found impersonating another student in any evaluation, will lead to suspension of one aca-
demic semester for the student.
The case is to be reported to the ADC to take it forward.
11.4.3 Impersonation: Tampering with official documents like grade sheets, medical certificates, etc.

A student, found forging signatures of faculty/staff, will lead to one year suspension for the student.</li></ol><p>11 DETERRENCE AGAINST ACADEMIC MALPRACTICES</p><p>11.4 Disciplinary corrections</p><p>The case is to be reported to the ADC to take it forward.</p><p>11.4.5 Copying in home assignments, laboratory reports and projects, etc.
In case of copying in home assignments, laboratory reports and projects, etc., no marks will be awarded
for such efforts. Repetition of such act for the second time will lead to further penalty of one grade in
the course. The student will be debarred from the course and a grade FW will be assigned in case the
similar act is repeated again. Punishment will be the same for all involved. The student from whom the
material was copied may not be punished in case the copying was done by hacking or similar means.
In this case, the CC/CI is solely empowered to take the decision.

one appeal
• to the ADC in case the disciplinary action is recommended by the DPGC or
• to the Senate in case the disciplinary action is recommended by the ADC.
The recommendation of the DPGC/ADC/separate committee/Senate will be sent to the Director for ap-
proval. The Dean (academics) will finally forward the recommendations/decisions to the academic office
for implementation.
In case of mercy or refrain, the concerned student must submit a signed letter stating that this is his/her
last misdeed for the remaining entire period of studentship, failing which will attract the expulsion from
the institute.</p><p>12 Awards and recognitions
It is the duty of IIT Jammu to recognise the efforts of the students who would strive hard to perform well
till the completion of the M.Tech. programme.
IIT Jammu also has the reservation to award a student against whom a disciplinary action has already
been taken by the institute. Therefore, it is also implied that any award provided by the institute at any
previous occasions is liable to be cancelled in future if the needs be. In that case, all the certificates and
medals might also be seized from the student by the institute.
The following medals are to be awarded to the graduating students if all the M.Tech. degree requirements
are satisfied:
12.1 Institute gold medal (M.Tech.) to a graduating student based on overall performance
A student with the highest CGPA, among all the M.Tech. students of the institute, will be accorded with
the Institute gold medal (M.Tech.) provided the student did not have any backlog course in any of the
semesters, CGPA ≥ 9.00 and there is no record of disciplinary actions against the student.
In case, there are more than one graduating students with identical CGPA up-to two decimal places, the
student who has earned more credits will be the awardee of the medal under consideration.
In case, the tie still persists, a committee might be constituted to break the tie and select the awardee if
the tie still persists.</p><p>13 CONCLUSION 12.2 Institute silver medal (M.Tech.)
12.2 Institute silver medals (M.Tech.) to the graduating students of every department
A student with the highest CGPA and who has secured the M.Tech. degree with CGPA ≥ 9.00, among
all the graduating students of the department excluding the awardee of Institute gold medal (M.Tech.) if
any one from the department, will be accorded with the institute silver medal. The similar guidelines as
mentioned in section 12.1 will be followed to select the awardee from every department.
