General FAQs
Helpline Number - +911912570633​  </p><p>About Branch/Discipline change
There is no provision of branch change in IIT Jammu curriculum. It is due to the provision of interdisciplinary nature of newly devised curriculum with a much wider common core encompassing many engineering disciplines flowing over to almost 4 semesters and branch core subjects starting right in the second semester. Many other features like design and research component, humanities breadth with social relevance, and minor area options are available to suit the students in exploring different Engineering discipline. The curriculum template has been structured to be inter-disciplinary and hands-on in nature to cater to the rapidly changing scientific /technological needs of the global community.</p><p>About Minor Degree requirements
Institute has a course credit system for evaluations. There are specific credit requirements for the award of the degree. Apart from a major degree in the admitted discipline at the time of admission, a student may pursue a minor degree in available interdisciplinary areas. One typically needs to earn a certain number of credits for the minor degree. The student might contact the Associate Dean (Academics) for more details one s/he joins IIT Jammu. The complete criteria to earn a minor degree consists of academic as well as non-academics components. Once a student joins, there will be sessions where all the rules and regulations will be informed and discussed in detail for the comprehensive understanding.</p><p>Fee payment: Kindly use Internet banking or bring DDs as instructions given below under list of documents section.

A student has to take various courses to complete the degree requirements. There will be credit/s associ-
ated with all courses, but the grade point/s might or might not be associated with the courses depending
on the category of the course.
2.1 Category of credit and grade point earning courses
In the curriculum, there are two following category of courses which are categorised in terms of possi-
bility of earning credits and grade points:</p><ol><li>Credit earning courses</li><li>Grade point earning courses
2.1.1 Credit earning course
A course from which a student will be able to earn credit/s only, but not the grade point/s, will be termed,
henceforth, as credit earning course (CEC). To earn credit/s from a CEC, a student has to complete the
course by successfully obtaining the satisfactory grade in that CEC, and by virtue of that, the student
will be able to earn the credit/s allotted with that CEC. In case the satisfactory grade is not obtained, it is
considered that the particular CEC is not completed by that student, i.e., the student needs to re-register
to the same CEC in future semesters. If the CEC is not an optional course and s/he needs to obtain the
satisfactory grade in that particular CEC, and then only the particular CEC will be completed by that
student.</li></ol><p>2.1.2 Grade point earning course
A course will be termed as grade point earning course (GPEC) if a student can earn credit/s as well as
grade points from a course. To earn grade points from a GPEC, a student has to complete the course by
successfully obtaining the minimum passing grade in that particular course. In case the minimum passing
grade is not obtained, it is considered that the particular GPEC is not completed by that student, i.e., the
student needs to re-register to the same GPEC in future semesters if the GPEC is not an optional course
and s/he needs to obtain the minimum passing grade in that GPEC, and then only the particular GPEC
will be completed by that student. It is worth to notice that by completing, i.e., by obtaining the minimum
passing grade in a GPEC, the student will be able to earn the credit/s allotted with that particular GPEC
in addition of earning the grade points. How much grade points a student would be able to earn from a
GPEC depends on the performance of the student in that GPEC and what grade is assigned to the student
by the CC of the particular GPEC. Details of a grade and the associated grade points are described in
section 3.</p><p>2.2 Credit/s of a course: Definition</p><ol><li>Different courses will be of different nature and might have different number of credit/s.</li><li>The number of credit/s associated with a course might be different depending on the number of
lecture/s or practical hours associated with that particular course.</li><li>Each credit of a course signifies that there will be 1 hr lecture per week, or 2 hrs of practicals or
laboratory/field training, seminar/project work etc. per week, and the course will be running for 14
weeks.</li><li>No credit is assigned for the directed studies or tutorial classes.</li><li>In the case of GPECs: Additionally, it is also expected that 1 − 2 hrs of self-study beyond class
room study per week is required from every student to earn 1 credit from a GPEC.
Self-study, generally, means study by him/her-self, carrying out the assignments, solve exercise
numerical problems from text book and reference books/materials, do the course related project
work/s if any, and any other preparations which help the students to learn the subject matters better
and make them strong and confident.</li><li>In the case of CECs: In the case of CECs, there is a need to implement a suitable evaluation
mechanism. The CI/CC might use his/her own discretion to follow an evaluation mechanism suitable
for that particular CEC. It is strongly recommended that the mechanism to be followed for the
evaluation needs to be intimated to the students at the very beginning of the CEC.
Therefore, 2 credits in a lecture based GPEC indicates that there will be lectures of 2 hrs per week
and accordingly every student is strongly advised to provide additional 2 − 4 hrs in a week beyond
the class room study to understand the subject matters of that GPEC. Similarly, 2 credits in labo-
ratory based GPEC indicates that there will be 4 hrs practicals or laboratory training per week and
accordingly, 2 − 4 hrs in a week the student needs to devote to write the laboratory report and for
the self-study.</li></ol><p>2.2.1 Significance of credits in the case of CECs:</p><ol><li>Let us consider that z i is the credits associated with the i th CEC.</li><li>For example, if a student secures a satisfactory grade SS in a CEC of credit z i , s/he will earn z i
credits. By virtue of that, s/he will accumulate z i credits in the category of CECs.</li><li>Therefore, one can realise that in a CEC, a student can earn only credit/s which is/are associated
with that course, but can not earn any grade point.</li><li>To earn credit/s, one has to secure satisfactory grade SS in a CEC.</li><li>In case the student receives unsatisfactory grade UU , s/he has to re-register for that course again in
the forthcoming semesters and secure satisfactory grade SS.</li><li>Let us also consider that the student has completed n number of such courses till date.</li><li>Therefore, the student has earned, till date, a total of Z =
n
i=1number of credits by virtue of
completing n number of CECs. This Z can also be termed as cumulative credits earned by the
student till date in the category of CECs.
2.2.2 Significance of credits in the case of GPECs:</li><li>Let us consider that c i is the credits associated with the i th course of such category.</li><li>Let us consider that g i is the grade point/s obtained by a student in the course under discussion.</li><li>Let us also consider that the student has completed p number of such courses till date.</li><li>Therefore, the student has earned, till date, a total of C =
p
i=1</li></ol><p>completing p number of such courses. This C can also be termed as cumulative credits earned by
the student till date in the category of GPECs.
2.2.3 Summary of criteria of minimum requirement of credits to obtain a B.Tech. degree
In order to obtain a B.Tech. degree, an UG student has typically has to earn both of the following credit
requirements through completing the CECs and GPECs:</p><ol><li>Z min ≈ 15</li><li>C min ≈ 140
The above mentioned numbers might slightly vary from one department to another. The exact department
specific credit requirements are to be notified by every department.
It also needs to be noticed that the mere satisfaction of all the criteria mentioned above does not guarantee
a B.Tech. degree; in addition, one needs to maintain a good moral character and adopt the best practices
as per the laws and constitution of India.</li></ol><p>2.3 Grade and grade point/s of a
course</p><p>2.3 Grade and grade point/s of a course: Definition</p><ol><li>The academic performance of a student in a GPEC, in which the student has registered, will be eval-
uated by the CC/CI. The measure of evaluation will be communicated, by the CC/CI, by assigning
various grades depending on the level of performance of the student in that GPEC.</li><li>Details of the grades and the associated grade points are available in section 3.</li></ol><p>2.4 Semester grade point average and cumulative grade point average
The semester grade point average (SGPA) and cumulative grade point average (CGPA) are the parameters
by which academic performance of a student in the GPECs is measured for a semester and across the
semesters, respectively.</p><p>2.4.1 SGPA: Determination procedure
In the case of GPECs, the academic performance of a student in a semester is measured by SGPA which
is determined as follows:</p><ol><li>Let us consider that a student, in a semester, has registered for r number of GPECs.</li><li>Let us consider that c i is/are the credits associated with the i th course of the category just mentioned
above.</li><li>Let us also consider that g i is/are the grade point/s obtained by the student in the i th course under
discussion.</li><li>Therefore, the SGPA of the student in that semester will be determined, after rounding off to two
decimal places, as follows:</li></ol><p>c i × g i (1)
r
c i

In the case of GPECs, the academic performance of a student till date is measured by CGPA which is
determined as follows:</p><ol><li>Let us consider that c i is the credits associated with the i th GPEC.</li><li>Let us consider that g i is the grade point/s obtained by a student in the course under discussion.</li><li>Let us also consider that the student has completed p number of GPECs and there are b number
backlog GPECs till date.</li><li>Therefore, the academic performance of that student till date will be measured by CGPA where</li></ol><p>c i × g i
p+b
c i
i=1
p
p+b
c i
i=1</p><p>(3)</p><p>CGPA is a real number and will be rounded off to two decimal places for all future references.
It can also be noticed that the number of registered courses r till date can be more than the sum of
the p number of completed courses and the b number backlog courses, i.e., r ≥ (p + b), in case a
course has not been passed/completed in the 2 nd or subsequent attempt/s as well.
5. Determination of CGPA in the case of repetition of a course: In those cases, where a course
will be repeated/substituted by a student, the latest grade obtained by the student will replace the
previous grade and the CGPA will be determined on the basis of the latest grade obtained by the
student.
A student might repeat a course in case the student has failed in an institute core (IC) or department
core (DC) course or is intending to improve the grade in a course, as per the guidelines provided
in section 7.6, which s/he has already completed earlier. A student might also substitute a course as
per the guidelines provided in section 7.5.
3 Grades of different nature and the associated grade points
To accommodate the two category of GPECs and CECs, two different nature of grades are to be assigned.
In the case of GPECs, various grades will carry different grade points depending on the performance of
a student in that course. For all the categories of courses, an uniform two letter grade convention will be
followed as listed in table 1.
The grade FP indicates that the student has failed in a GPEC due to poor academic performance and the
student has to repeat the course in future semester/s in case the course is not optional.
Y The grade FW indicates that the course is withdrawn beyond the allowable time limit and/or the
student did not maintain adequate attendance in that course during the semester. As a result, a failing
grade FW , which is equivalent to the grade FP , is assigned. Therefore, the student has to repeat the
course in future semester/s in case the course is not optional.
The grade FW can also be assigned in case of disciplinary actions against the academic malpractices.</p><p>4

14 UU - - Unsatisfactory</p><p>YY The grade FN indicates that the student did not take the end semester examination and therefore, a
failing grade, which is also equivalent to the grade FP , is assigned which compels the student to
repeat the course all together in future semester/s in case the course is not optional. In case the
student could not able to take the end semester examination due to genuine reasons, the conduction
of make-up end semester examination will be permitted by the SUGB, as per the guidelines provided in
section 4.10, after receiving the formal request from the student and consequently, an appropriate
grade will be assigned without any penalty. The new appropriate grade will supersede the previously
assigned grade FN .
The grade WW indicates that the student has withdrawn the course during a specified time period. More
details can be obtained in section 5.5.2.</p><p>4 Examinations and assessments
Different assessment procedures are to be adopted depending on the nature of courses. General guidelines
are being provided in this section.
4.1 Evaluation modes of theoretical courses
A template of the evaluation scheme for the theoretical courses are provided in table 2. A part of the
template will strictly be adhered and the remaining part will be flexible one depending on the nature of
the course and the mutual agreement among the students, and the CI/s and/or CC.
4.1.1 Responsibility of the CI/CC to conduct the evaluations
Except the mid. and end semester examinations, all other evaluations will be conducted by the CI/CC at
regular intervals without disturbing the overall class schedule of the institute. Institute will schedule the
mid. and end semester examinations. The conduction of class tests 1 and 2 at two halves of the running
semester for a minimum duration 30 min for each of the tests is mandatory.</p><p>4 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>4.2 Lab.

It is the mandatory requirement for a student to take the end semester examination to be eligible to
receive a passing grade in a GPEC. It does not matter what are the marks obtained by a student in all the
evaluations conducted during the in-semester course works.
Make-up end semester examination: In case a student could not take the end semester examination
due to genuine reasons, the student needs to apply, as mentioned in section 4.10, to the Dean (aca-
demics) with proper justification and submission of documentary evidences to receive the approval
to take the make-up end semester examination.
Make-up in-semester evaluations: For not taking any one of the in-semester evaluations including the
mid. semester examination, the CI/CC will decide whether to conduct the make-up examination or
not. The CI/CC is/are strongly advised to pre-announce the policy, at the beginning of the semester,
for make-up examination of the in-semester evaluations.
4.2 Evaluation modes of laboratory courses
An optional template, for the evaluation scheme of the laboratory courses, is suggested as follows:</p><ol><li>Weekly experiments: 6-12 no. of experiments Weightage: 30 − 60 %</li><li>Project assignment: Hands-on project experience in a group Weightage: 10 − 30 %</li><li>Mid. sem. evaluation: Skill test (One experiment to be performed) Weightage: 10 − 20 %</li><li>End sem. evaluation: Skill test (One experiment to be performed) Weightage: 10 − 20 %</li><li>End sem. viva voce and/or written test: Weightage: 10 − 30 %

4.4 Transcript
Transcript, generally to be issued to a student by the institute at the end of the completion of the degree
programme, is a consolidated academic performance report of a student with the collection of information
compiled from all the SGRs.
An interim transcript can also be issued to a student at any time during the B.Tech. programme after
receiving a request from the student and payment of the applicable fee.
4.4.1 Additional contents of the transcript
A transcript to be issued by IIT Jammu will provide the following additional information:</li><li>In case, an UG student is pursuing for minor, honours, double minor, semester internship, research
and development project (RDP) or any other similar additional course loads, a consolidated and
up-to-date performance report associated with all such additional courses will also be provided.</li></ol><p>4 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>4.5 Display of the answer
booklets</p><ol start="2"><li>Though it is not intended to categorise the overall CGPA, obtained by an UG student who has been
awarded a B.Tech. degree from IIT Jammu, into the first, second and third divisions; it might be
necessary in future when such categorisation is required to be provided by IIT Jammu so that the
B.Tech. degree awardee of IIT Jammu can comply the criteria set by different external agencies and
make them eligible to apply for a job, submit an application or to satisfy any other requirements. For
the benefits of the students to deal with such situations, a conversion table 3 is provided which cor-
relates the CGPA and the first, second and third divisions. This conversion table 3 will be provided
at the reverse side of the transcript.

need to inform what is the medium of instructions in the UG engineering programme. To satisfy
such requirement, it would be mentioned, that the medium of instructions in IIT Jammu is English,
at the reverse side of the transcript to be issued by IIT Jammu.
4.5 Display of the evaluated answer booklets
It is the responsibility of the students to verify the answer booklets after being evaluated by the CI/s
or CC. One should make him/her-self convenient to be present when the answer booklets would be
displayed by the CI/s or CC at a pre-announced place, date and time.</li><li>All in-semester and end-semester evaluated answer booklets will be shown to the students before
submitting the grades.</li><li>Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC:
(a) It should be the practice to display the evaluated answer booklets of the mid. and end semester
examinations within 3 − 4 days from the last date of respective examinations.
(b) All in-semester evaluations should be completed and shown to the students well before the
commencement of the end semester examination.</li><li>Advisory to the students:
(a) Students are advised to be in the IIT campus up to the last date of grade submission.
(b) They should remain prepared to re-check the evaluated answer booklets upon receiving an
email announcement by the CI/s or CC with two-hour notice period.
4.6 Disclosing of the total marks and grades
Depending on the total marks obtained by a student in a course, an appropriate grade will be assigned
at the sole discretion of the CC. In general, the following procedure will be adopted to submit the final
grades:</li></ol><p>4 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>4.7 Re-totalling</p><ol><li>Total marks along with all the break-ups and the respective weightages are to be made available by
the CC on or before the penultimate day of the last date of grade submission so that the students can
inform the CC in case of any modifications required.</li><li>Last date of grade submission will typically be 3 − 4 days after the last date of end semester exam-
ination.</li><li>Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC:
(a) All CCs should submit the grades to the academic office on or before the last date of the grade
submission.
(b) There should be the practice that all the CIs, CCs and the Head of department will have a grade
moderation meeting together on the following day of the grade submission date.
(c) The grade distributions and the grading scheme should be analysed to identify the need of
reduction of skewed grade distribution if any and suggest the modifications to the CC.
(d) In case, the CC is not present in the grade moderation meeting, the CI will take the decision
whether to modify the grades or not. In absence of both of the CC and CI, the Head of depart-
ment will be empowered to modify the grades if required.
(e) After the grade moderation meeting, the grades will be frozen and made available to the stu-
dents on the next day of the grade moderation meeting.
(f) In order to complete all the requirements to submit the grades by the date prescribed, all the
faculty members are requested not to avail any leave, unless very urgent, during this period.
(g) In case of large number of answer booklets to be evaluated and date of the end semester exam-
ination at the end stage of the examination week, or any other unavoidable circumstances, one
has to take prior approval from the chairperson of the Senate, the Director, in order to extend
the date of grade submission.</li><li>A student would be able to see his/her grades on the following day of the grade moderation meeting
provided the student has submitted the course feedbacks on-line.
4.7 Request for re-totalling and/or the change of grade
A student has to make a request for re-totalling of the answer booklet of the end semester examination,
or the change of grade.</li><li>Request for re-totalling and/or the change of grade is to be made by the students to the Dean (aca-
demics) within 15 days from the last date of grade submission.</li><li>Once the request receives the approval from the Dean (academics), the re-totalling will be carried
out by the CI/CC upon receiving an instruction from the Dean (academics) and the grades will be
changed by the CI/CC appropriately with improved/reduced grade points if the needs be.</li><li>Request for change of grade only without the request for the re-totalling of the answer booklet
will receive due importance by the Dean (academics) once the hint/s of inconsistencies is/are being
depicted through documentary evidences provided by the student.</li></ol><p>4 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>4.8 Retention</p><p>4.8 Retention of evaluated answer booklets
Considering that the re-evaluation of the answer booklets, if any, will be completed by one semester, the
following policy will be followed for the retention of the evaluated answer booklets:</p><ol><li>The evaluated answer booklets will be retained for the next one semester by the CC.</li><li>In the absence of the CC, the CI will take care of the answer booklets.</li><li>In the absence of the CC and CI both, the department will take care of the answer booklets provided
those are handed over to the department by the CC/CI.
4.9 Attendance policy
Students are requested to attend all the classes. However, 75 % attendance is mandatory to pass a course.
4.9.1 Advisory to the all concerned to aim for active participation
The objective of the students should be to actively participate in the class with an intent to learn.
Kindly notice that an absence, in one lecture even, might develop technical as well as psychological dis-
comfort towards the course. Subsequently it might attract absence in the next lecture as well. Therefore,
do attend the lectures if not impossible.</li><li>Students need to study at hostels during the off periods and remain up-to-date so to be confident to
ask questions in the lectures.</li><li>There should be mutual interactions so that the doubts can be cleared.</li><li>Clear the doubts latest by the next lecture and then, proceed further.
4.9.2 Policy to promote attendance and discourage absence
Low attendance in a single course: The following attendance policy might be followed:</li><li>To promote the attendance, mutually decided incentive scheme (for e.g., addition of 5 extra marks)
may be implemented for the students having attendance beyond a certain limit (for e.g., attendance
≥ 90 % or in similar range).</li><li>For the deterrence to loss of interests through absence in several lectures, if the attendance &lt; 75 %,
the course will considered to be withdrawn beyond the allowable time limit and/or the attendance
is inadequate. A grade FW or UU , as deemed appropriate, depending on the category of GPEC or
CEC respectively, will be assigned.</li><li>Surprise tests for short durations might be conducted frequently.</li><li>Any other attendance policy, the CI/s and/or CC might adopt in consultation with the students. Once
fixed, the policy should be documented and clearly be intimated to the students.
Low attendance in several courses: In case, a student receives grade FW in 4 or more GPECs in
a single semester without the valid reasons according to the discretion of the SUGB, the student will
be put on probation for a semester. In the semester under probation, if the student continues to receive
grades FW in 2 more GPECs, the student will lose the privilege of lodging and boarding in the hostel
accommodation provided by the institute.</li></ol><p>4 ASSESSMENTS</p><p>4.10 Make-up</p><p>4.9.3 Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC
Records of all lecture-wise attendance of the students should be maintained by the CI/s or CC and shared
with the students.
4.10 Make-up end semester examination
The make-up end semester examination will be conducted only if it is approved by the Dean (academics)
upon receiving the request for such from the student. The Dean (academics) is empowered by the Sen-
ate to decide whether the reasons for not taking the end semester examination are genuine or not, and
therefore, the decision taken by the Dean (academics) is final and binding to the all concerned.
4.10.1 Eligibility for the make-up end semester examination
A student will be eligible for the make-up end semester examination if all of the following conditions
are satisfied:</p><ol><li>In case of severe personal health problems for the student, unavoidable family commitments or
any other valid reasons beyond the control of the student, the student has to apply, to the Dean
(academics) through proper channel within the maximum allowable time limit as prescribed by
the institute. The student needs to submit the necessary supporting documents which the Dean
(academics) can consider to be the enough documentary evidence in favour of the genuineness of
the reasons for not taking the end semester examination.
In case of absence in the end semester examination due to health problems, all the supporting doc-
uments need to be authenticated by the IIT hospital.
Rather than waiting for the grades to be displayed by the institute, such students are advised to
submit the application for the make-up end semester examination, as mentioned above, at the earliest
convenience.</li><li>The student has received a grade FN in case of a GPEC. In case of a CEC, the student needs to
maintain adequate attendance as expected by the concerned CI/CC.
If a grade FW is offered in case of a GPEC, the course will considered to be withdrawn because of
inadequate attendance and therefore, the student will not be eligible for the make-up end semester
examination.</li><li>The request of the student to take the make-up end semester examination needs to be approved by
the Dean (academics).
4.10.2 Procedures to be followed to conduct the make-up end semester examination
The make-up end semester examination, after the approval from the Dean (academics), will be conducted
as per the following guidelines:</li><li>The make-up end semester examination will be conducted before the commencement of the forth-
coming semester.</li><li>The CC/CI will set the question paper for the make-up end semester examination. The CC/CI might
conduct the make-up examination by him-/her-self or nominate a faculty member for its conduction.</li><li>Grades might be submitted by 2 − 3 days by the CC/CI after evaluating the original answer booklet.</li></ol><p>5 REGISTRATION</p><p>5 Registration
Registration is the mandatory pre-requisite for a student to be eligible to take courses in a semester.</p><p>5.1 Academic calendar for the semesters
At the beginning of autumn and spring semesters, every student needs to register for the courses. Tentative
academic calendar for the semesters are as follows:</p><ol><li>Autumn: Third/fourth/final week of July - Fourth/final week of November</li><li>Spring: First week of January - Fourth/final week of April</li><li>Summer: First week of May - Third/fourth week of July
During summer semester, no course will, generally, be offered.
5.2 Semester-wise registration
For the registration, one should know what are the courses to be running in that semester and which
courses the student needs to take.</li><li>It is the responsibility of the student to know the exact requirements and accordingly, one needs to
register.</li><li>Students are advised to consult the assigned FA before registering for the courses. There will be one
departmental FA for a batch of students of same year.</li><li>It is the responsibility of the students to approach their respective FA along with the SGRs so to get
advised by the FA appropriately.</li><li>It is the student who has to ensure that s/he have registered the courses as per the department and
institute specified norms.
(a) The student should know what are the mandatory courses one has to register and do the regis-
tration accordingly.
(b) The student should know what are the available options within which one has to register for
the optional courses and do the registration accordingly.
(c) The student should know what are the flexibilities available within the registration process and
select the courses accordingly so that the maximum and minimum allowable credit limits do
not get violated.
(d) It is the responsibility of the student to choose the courses which do not clash with the time-
table. The courses chosen with the time-table clash may result in the withdrawal of a course
and therefore, it might invite the associated consequences as referred in the section 3.</li></ol><p>5 REGISTRATION</p><p>5.3 Registration process</p><p>5.3 Procedure for registration
All the registration processes and subsequent modifications, if required, are generally needed to be
carried out through on-line.
Pre-requisites for the registration are as follows:</p><ol><li>All institute, library, hostel and mess dues are to be cleared.</li><li>All course feedbacks of the previous semester are to be submitted on-line beforehand.
5.4 Registration time line
Every student needs to register on-line at the beginning of the semester within the institute prescribed
time period to be mentioned in the academic calendar. Along with the on-line registration, the students
need to be physically present in the institute campus at-least before two days the classes start. In case
a student fails to report his/her physical presence within the time limit just mentioned above, the stu-
dent would be de-registered from the semester, i.e., on-line registration, if done, will be cancelled and
effectively, there will be a semester drop for that particular student.
5.5 Course adjustment during the semester
After the registration process and during the initial stage of the semester when the courses are running,
there is a provision to adjust the courses in case a student is not comfortable with the courses. The
following guidelines are to be followed for the course adjustment:
5.5.1 Addition/deletion of course/s during the semester</li><li>A student can add/drop the courses within the institute prescribed time period which will typically
be within 2 weeks from the first date of the beginning of the classes. Any addition or deletion of
course/s during this time period will not be mentioned in the SGR/transcript.</li><li>All other conditions of the registration remain the same.
Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC
The following advisories are recommended to the CI/s and/or CC:</li><li>Should not take leave, within the maximum allowable time period for the course adjustment, unless
urgent.</li><li>Advised to compensate the classes, if any, within the time period itself so that students get enough
exposure to decide whether to continue or discontinue from the registered courses.</li><li>Advised to conduct one class test, of standard quality, during this time period.</li></ol><p>5 REGISTRATION</p><p>5.6 Semester drop</p><p>5.5.2 Withdrawal of course/s during the semester</p><ol><li>Maximum allowable time period for the course withdrawal will be mentioned in the academic cal-
endar which will typically be 1 week after the mid. semester examination. One needs to withdraw
the course/s by this time.</li><li>In case of a withdrawl of a course beyond the last day of add/drop of a course and before the final
day of a course withdrawl, a grade WW will be assigned against the course.</li><li>No more course withdrawal will be possible beyond the time period just mentioned. Absence in
the classes without the course withdrawal within the allowable time limit will attract assigning a
grade FW or UU which is equivalent to the grade FP or UU depending on the GPECs or CECs,
respectively.
Advisory to the CI/s and/or CC
The CC is, therefore, strongly recommended to complete the evaluation of answer booklets of the mid.
semester examination and show those to the students by 4 days of the end of the mid. semester exam-
ination so that the students can take a decision whether to continue or withdraw the course within the
maximum allowable time period for the course withdrawal.
5.6 Semester drop
Semester drop within and beyond the first 12 semesters will be dealt differently. However, in both the
cases of semester drop, the student needs to take permission from his/her guardian/parents, and a docu-
ment endorsed by him/her-self and his/her guardian/parents needs to be submitted to the academic office.
5.6.1 Semester drop during the first 12 semesters
Semester drop, within the first 12 semesters, without the approval from the SUGB might result in the
termination of the studentship upon receiving a recommendation from the SUGB.
However, there is a provision that a student, within the first 12 semesters, may drop the entire semester,
subject to the prior approval from the SUGB, under the following circumstances:</li><li>There is severe personal health problems for the student, unavoidable family commitments or any
other valid reasons beyond the control of the student.</li><li>It is advised to take the prior approval from the SUGB before the commencement of the semester
registration process in case of a need of such semester drop.</li><li>In case of the need to drop the registered semester for genuine reasons, it would not be permissible
beyond the first day of the commencement of the institute end semester examination or there is
inadequate attendance in any one of the course.</li><li>In case of health problems, all the supporting documents need to be authenticated by the IIT hospital.</li><li>All the supporting documents, as the proof of the genuineness of the reasons for the semester drop,
are to be submitted to the SUGB for the required approval. It is the discretion of the SUGB whether
to provide the approval or not on the case to case basis.</li></ol><p>6 FLEXIBILITIES IN THE B.TECH PROGRAMME</p><ol start="6"><li>Semester drop, for more than 2 semesters in continuation, is normally not permissible.</li><li>In case of a semester drop, no hostel accommodation will be provided by the institute.
5.6.2 Semester drop beyond the first 12 semesters
Semester drop beyond the first 12 semesters will be dealt with as per the rules and regulations mentioned
in section 6.1.1.
6 Flexibilities in the B.Tech. programme
In addition to the regular B.Tech. programme, IIT Jammu offers special provision to cater to the different
needs of the students performing differently.
6.1 Features of the B.Tech. programme
The curriculum, needs to be followed by the UG students, in general, to obtain a B.Tech. degree. from
IIT Jammu, is provided in section A.
6.1.1 Duration of the B.Tech. programme
Duration of the B.Tech. programme at IIT Jammu might vary as follows:
Duration in general: It is expected that an UG student, in general, will take 8 semesters to obtain a
B.Tech. degree. Though recommended, it is not mandatory that an UG student has to complete the
B.Tech. degree requirements within 8 semesters.
Limited time period for a hostel accommodation: A hostel accommodation for a maximum of 12
semesters to an UG student will be provided by IIT Jammu, and during this period, the regular
fees prescribed by the institute will be applicable for an UG student.
Beyond 12 semesters: In case, an UG student has spent more than 12 semesters, the total number of
backlog courses ≤ 7 and all the B.Tech. degree requirements are yet to be obtained, the following
strategy will be adopted:</li><li>The student will be eligible for the relaxation as mentioned in section 7.7 to complete the
remaining credit requirements of the B.Tech. degree.</li><li>The student can choose for an UG diploma, instead of a B.Tech. degree, following the guide-
lines given in section 7.9.</li><li>In case, the option of an UG diploma is not preferred, the procedures to be followed to obtain
the B.Tech. degree are as follows:
(a) In general, the studentship will be put into the dormant stage.
(b) The UG student might have to complete the remaining credit requirements following the
revised curriculum, rules and regulations to be followed at that time.
(c) Therefore, such students have to apply to SUGB for reinstatement of the studentship from
the dormant stage. It is also required to provide a reasonable and realistic plan with a finite
time line which the student will follow to complete the remaining credit requirements.</li></ol><p>6 FLEXIBILITIES IN THE B.TECH PROGRAMME</p><p>6.2 Controlled course load</p><p>(d) The SUGB will decide on case to case basis.
(e) In case the approval is received from the SUGB, the student needs to follow the guidelines
provided by the SUGB.
(f) No hostel accommodation will be provided by IIT Jammu, and then onwards, a revised
tuition and other necessary fees will be applicable.
(g) In case of a discontinuation for a semester or more, the studentship will again be put into
the dormant stage. For reinstatement of the studentship further from the dormant stage,
one has to follow the similar guidelines just mentioned above.</p><p>6.1.2 Semester wise course loads
In the section A where the general structure of the UG curriculum is mentioned, table 6 provides the
information of the different types of courses, a student needs to register every semester and how much
should be the credit/s an UG student should earn in that semester for a general period of 8 semesters in
continuation.
Curriculum suggested semester wise course load
The curriculum suggested semester wise course loads, considering the GPECs only, for all the 8
semesters are summarised and listed in table 4 for the convenience of the all concerned.
Regular course load per semester
To provide flexibility, a student, in general, can enhance the semester course load by opting for one
additional lecture based course of 3 credits in comparison to the curriculum suggested semester wise
course load. The provision is applicable third semester onwards. This flexible semester wise course load
can be termed as the regular course load per semester and its distribution over the semesters is also listed
is table 4.

It can be noticed that the minimum credit requirements for the semesters V II − V III are relatively less
in comparison to the other semesters. It is because the students will be looking for the opportunities in
placement and/or higher studies as well.
6.2 Flexibilities for the students performing modestly in academics
The student, who is performing modestly in academics, will be recommended for controlled course load
per semester so that s/he can perform well in the courses s/he has registered and develop confidence in the
academics. Once the student start performing well with the controlled course load, the course moderation
will be withdrawn, and the student will be advised to take regular course load.</p><p>6 FLEXIBILITIES IN THE B.TECH PROGRAMME</p><p>6.2 Controlled course load</p><p>6.2.1 Criteria for the course load moderation
A student will be recommended for the moderated course load if the CGPA of a student is lower than
6.00, i.e., CGPA &lt; 6.00 or both of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><ol><li><p>Total number of backlogs in GPECs ≥ 3</p></li><li><p>Number of backlogs in GPECs in the last concluded semester ≥ 1
It is to be noticed that CGPA &lt; 6.00 will make a student ineligible for campus placement and therefore,
it is the need to implement controlled course load for a student so that the student can improve the CGPA
with reduced course work per semester.
6.2.2 Controlled course load and its monitoring
Important features of the controlled course load are as follows:</p></li><li><p>Undertaking from the guardian/parents: Once the criteria for the course load moderation gets
satisfied, a student needs to submit the undertakings from him/her-self and his/her guardian/parents
in a prescribed format to register for the courses in the next semester.</p></li><li><p>Course load per semester: Course load per semester will be controlled in the following manner:
(a) The total semester course load, to start with, will be reduced by the load of a single lecture
based course in comparison to the curriculum suggested semester wise course load.
(b) In case, the student passes in all the GPECs with the reduced course load and improves the
CGPA equal to or beyond 6.00, the student will be eligible to take the curriculum suggested
semester wise course load in the next semester.
In case, the student does not pass in all the courses with the reduced course load or improves
the CGPA equal to or beyond 6.00, the student will continue to take reduced course load in the
next semester as well.
(c) In the subsequent semester, if the student takes curriculum suggested semester wise course
load, passes in all the courses and maintains the CGPA equal to or beyond 6.00, the student
will also be eligible to take regular course load in the forthcoming semester.
In the semester under consideration, if the student takes regular course load and does not pass
in all the courses or the CGPA falls below 6.00, the student will again be recommended to
take controlled course load, i.e., one fewer lecture based course than the curriculum suggested
semester wise course load in the forthcoming semester will be allowed to the student.</p></li><li><p>Advisory to meet the FA: The student, taking controlled course load, needs to consult the respective
FA before registering for the courses.
Such students are also advised to meet the respective FAs regularly after the registration process
at any time during the semester with a prior appointment from the FA, and discuss their concerns,
problems and any other academic or non-academic issues with the FA. It might help the students to
stress-out the situations and feel better.</p></li><li><p>Restraining to hold student representative institute/hostel level office bearer positions: To limit
the possibility of losing focus from academics, the students, undergoing controlled course load, are
strongly recommended not to hold any student representative positions at institute/hostel level.
However, they are advised to mingle with the rest of the students, involve in sports, recreational and
any other activities which rejuvenate their minds and do not affect the academics.
6.3 Flexibilities for the students aspiring for higher academic challenges
The students, who are consistently and successfully crossing the normal boundary of the regular B.Tech.
programme, are allowed to challenge themselves, depending on their self willingness, to go extra mile to
obtain more than the regular B.Tech. degree.
An UG student can opt for any one or all of the following options provided the student continues to
perform well with the regular course load while being overloaded themselves at the same time with
additional course load as well:</p></li><li><p>B.Tech. degree with minor</p></li><li><p>B.Tech. degree with honors</p></li><li><p>B.Tech. degree with semester internship
To take the present discussion further, the following terminologies are introduced: The department where
the student has taken the admission might be called as the major department. Any department other than
the major department might be called as the minor department for that particular student.
6.4 Features of the B.Tech. degree with minor
A student, by virtue of completing additional GPECs from a basket of courses prescribed by that minor
department, can earn a B.Tech. degree with minor from that (minor) department.
6.4.1 Credit requirements for a B.Tech. degree with minor
To obtain a B.Tech. degree with minor, additional 12 credits need to be obtained by an UG student from
a basket of courses identified by the minor department. The courses accounting for the minor degree
need to be different from the courses taken to complete the regular B.Tech. degree requirements. While
registering, a student needs to mention specifically what are the courses s/he will opt to obtain the B.Tech.
degree with minor.</p></li></ol><p>6.4.2 Monitoring the progress of a student pursuing for a B.Tech. degree with minor
The following procedures will be adopted to monitor the progress of a student interested in a B.Tech.
degree with minor:</p><ol><li><p>A student, with SGPA ≥ 7.00 in all the semesters starting from 2 nd year onwards and no backlog
course till date, can start pursuing for a B.Tech. degree with minor.</p></li><li><p>The student needs to maintain SGPA ≥ 7.00 in all the subsequent semesters to remain eligible to
pursue a B.Tech. degree with minor.</p></li><li><p>Minor can be awarded at the end of the V III semester if the exclusive CGPA considering all the
minor courses is 6.00 or above, i.e., CGPA minor ≥ 6.00.</p></li><li><p>No additional time beyond the V III semester will be provided to obtain the minor.</p></li><li><p>At the end of the V III semester, if a student satisfies all the criteria to earn a B.Tech. degree with
minor,
(a) the student needs to apply for the minor and
(b) after verification, an appropriate recommendation to the Senate will be made.
In that case, a certificate for the minor degree will be provided with the following options:
(a) The student can opt for a certificate for the minor degree stating the exclusive CGPA for the
minor courses.
(b) The student can also opt for a certificate for the minor degree without stating the exclusive
CGPA for the minor courses.
It is to be noticed that the CGPA for the regular B.Tech. degree will always be different from that
for the minor degree.</p></li><li><p>In case, a student can not satisfy all the criteria to obtain a B.Tech. degree with minor; the courses,
for which the student has earned extra credits under minor category, will be mentioned in the tran-
script as additional learning provided a request is received from the student.</p></li></ol><p>6.5 Features of the B.Tech. degree with honours
A student, by virtue of completing additional GPECs from a basket of courses prescribed by the major
department, can earn a B.Tech. degree with honours from that (major) department.
6.5.1 Credit requirements for a B.Tech. degree with honours
To obtain a B.Tech. degree with honours, additional 12 credits from a basket of courses prescribed by
the major department need to be obtained by an UG student. At the most, a course of 3 credits can be
replaced by a research and development project (RDP) which will be different from the B.Tech. project
(BTP). The courses accounting for the honours degree need to be different from the courses taken to
complete the regular B.Tech. degree requirements.
6.5.2 Monitoring the progress of a student pursuing for a B.Tech. degree with honours
The following procedures will be adopted to monitor the progress of a student looking for a B.Tech.
degree with honours:</p><ol><li>A student will remain eligible to start and continue to pursue a B.Tech. degree with honours if all of
the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) SGPA ≥ 7.50 in all the semesters starting from 2 nd year onwards
(b) CGPA ≥ 7.50 in all the semesters starting from 2 nd year onwards
(c) No backlog in GPECs at any point of time</li></ol><p>7 SPECIALTIES IN THE REGISTRATION</p><p>6.6 B.Tech. degree with semester internship</p><ol start="2"><li>Honours can be awarded at the end of the V III semester if the exclusive CGPA considering all the
courses for the honours degree is 6.50 or above, i.e., CGPA honours ≥ 6.50.</li><li>No additional time beyond the V III semester will be provided to obtain the honours.</li><li>At the end of the V III semester, if a student satisfies all the criteria to earn a B.Tech. degree with
honours,
(a) the student needs to apply for the honours and
(b) after verification, an appropriate recommendation to the Senate will be made.
In that case, a certificate for the honours degree will be provided with the following options:
(a) The student can opt for a certificate for the honours degree stating the exclusive CGPA for the
honours courses.
(b) The student can also opt for a certificate for the honours degree without stating the exclusive
CGPA for the honours courses.
It is to be noticed that the CGPA for the regular B.Tech. degree will always be different from that
for the honours degree.</li><li>In case, a student can not satisfy all the criteria to obtain a B.Tech. degree with honours; the courses,
for which the student has earned extra credits, will be mentioned in the transcript as additional
learning provided a request is received from the student.
6.6 Features of the B.Tech. degree with semester internship
A student, as per the present provision in IIT Jammu, can opt for a B.Tech. degree with semester intern-
ship following the guidelines mentioned in section 7.2.1.
A student can opt for a semester internship provided the student satisfies the following criteria:</li><li>The current CGPA ≥ 7.00.</li><li>In the records of the B.Tech. programme of the student in the institute, there is no
(a) backlog course till date in any of the previous semesters and
(b) instance of disciplinary actions taken against the student by the institute.
6.7 B.Tech. degree with several combinations
In case, a student is interested in obtaining a B.Tech. degree with honours, minors and/or double minors
with the semester internship, the student needs to complete all the specific requirements of the above
mentioned options separately.</li></ol><p>7 Specialties in the registration
IIT Jammu provides the following special allowances in the registration process:</p><p>7 SPECIALTIES IN THE REGISTRATION</p><p>7.1 B.Tech Project</p><p>7.1 B.Tech. project
Every UG student has to carry out a B.Tech. project (BTP) in two stages. The first stage needs to be
carried out in the V II semester and the second stage will be carried out in the V III semester.
In case of a need, a BTP can be done in a group of 2 − 3 students. In that case, every student should
demonstrate his/her distinct contributions.
7.1.1 BTP allotment
The following policy will be followed for the allotment of the BTP:</p><ol><li>An UG student has to choose a topic for his/her BTP by the 6 th semester as prescribed by the
department.</li><li>In general, for 90 % of admitted strength of the batch, there will be at-least one supervisor from the
faculty of the parent department to which the student is admitted.</li><li>In case the UG students are interested in pursuing inter disciplinary BTP work, 10 % of the admitted
strength of the batch will be eligible to choose the sole supervisor outside the parent department.
The limit of 10 % can further be increased by the concerned DUGC.</li><li>Whenever a supervisor leaves the institute permanently/temporarily, the DUGC, at its discretion,
will make alternative arrangements if needed.</li></ol><p>7.1.2 Evaluation of BTP
The policy to be adopted for the evaluation of the BTP is as follows:</p><ol><li>The first stage evaluation of the BTP will be done by the supervisor/s. Supervisor/s may co-opt
examiner/s additionally if interested.</li><li>For the evaluation of the second stage BTP, a committee will be formed including supervisor/s and
at-least one examiner from the department. The examiner/s will be chosen by the supervisor/s.</li><li>In the case of a BTP in which the sole supervisor is from outside the department, a committee
will be formed by the supervisor considering at-least one examiner from each of the concerned
departments. Anyway, the supervisor will be a member of the BTP evaluation committee.</li><li>In the case of evaluation of the second stage BTP, the supervisor/s will have 60 % weightage and
the other committee member/s will have the rest of 40 % weightage.</li><li>In case of more than one supervisors or examiners, all supervisors or examiners will have equal
weightages in their respective categories.</li><li>The final grade of the second stage of the BTP will be determined as follows:
(a) Depending on the performance of a student, a grade will be provided by the committee mem-
bers individually.
(b) Next, a grade point will be determined based on a weighted average of the grade points pro-
vided by the committee member/s following the weightages mentioned above.</li></ol><p>7 SPECIALTIES IN THE REGISTRATION</p><p>7.2 Internship</p><p>(c) In case of fractional value of the resultant grade point, ceiling function will be used to convert
the fractional grade point into an integer grade point.
(d) Finally, an appropriate grade corresponding to the integer grade point will be assigned.
7. The determination of the final grade from the grades assigned by the individual members of the
committee will be carried out, following the procedure mentioned above, by the convener of the
committee. The supervisor, him/her-self, will act as the convener of the committee also.
Let us understand the BTP grading policy from the following examples:
Example #1: Let us consider there is one supervisor and one examiner in the committee for the evalu-
ation of the second stage BTP. Let the grades assigned by the supervisor and examiners be AB and BC
respectively to a student for a particular BTP.
Therefore, the resultant weighted average grade point will be 0.60 × 9 + 0.40 × 7 = 8.20. After ceiling
function, the final grade point will be elevated to next higher integer number 9 and therefore, a grade AB,
corresponding to the grade point 9, will be assigned to the student against the BTP under consideration.
Example #2: Let us consider there is two supervisors and three examiners in the committee for the
evaluation of the second stage BTP. Let the grades assigned by the supervisors be BB and AB. Let the
grades assigned by the examiners be AB, BB and BC.
8.30. After ceiling function, the final grade point will be elevated to next higher integer number 9 and
therefore, a grade AB, corresponding to the grade point 9, will be assigned to the student against the
BTP under consideration.
7.2 Internship
An internship, subject to the approval from the training and placement office (TPO) of IIT Jammu, is
mandatory for all the UG students to obtain a B.Tech. degree. For the internship, the students need to
consult the TPO for more detailed information and complete guidelines.
7.2.1 Provision of semester internship
In addition to the (regular) internship, an UG student, might opt for the semester internship as well. To
be eligible for the semester internship, it might be the need to earn the credits reserved for that particular
semester by the student before the commencement of the internship. For more detailed information and
requirements, TPO needs to be consulted and one should follow the TPO guidelines.
There might be a provision for a semester internship in an institute/university of national/international
repute by earning credits from that institute/university provided those credits are earned by completing
the similar/equivalent to core courses, as per the IIT Jammu B.Tech. degree requirements and course
curriculum, are completed. TPO should be consulted for more detailed information.
It needs to be noticed that an UG student can avail the semester internship subject to the prior approval
from the Dean (academics). In this regard, the TPO is going to act as the felicitator which will formulate
the strategy for the semester internship in consultation with the Dean (academics); however, the TPO
will administer the process. A department committee might be formed to evaluate/monitor the perfor-
mance/progress of a student undergoing semester internship during or at the end of the internship as
appropriate.</p><p>7.3 Audit course
Students might prefer to take additional courses, beyond the minimum requirements prescribed by the
institute, to enhance the depth and breadth in the knowledge domain. They might also look for focusing
on a certain, but significant, segment of the course contents for the purpose of carrying out a project of
interest with the help of the segmented knowledge s/he wants to obtain from the course. Therefore, the
student might also prefer not to put the same amount of rigour for the rest of the course contents. To make
the students eligible to go through such course and have a formal recognition of such additional efforts,
institute provides the provision where a student might prefer to register for a course with an option of
“audit” rather than registering the course as the regular one.</p><ol><li>In a course the student has registered as audit, no credit as well as grade point can be obtained by
the student in that course.</li><li>Grade: A grade SA will be assigned to a student in case the performance of the student in that
course opted for audit is up to the level of satisfactory.</li><li>Advisory to the student: .
(a) The student needs to consult the CI/CC before registering for such course.</li><li>To make a student serious about the course opted for audit and also to avoid the possibility of
creating negative environment by such students, the student might be disallowed in the course by
the CI/CC at any time if the need be.
7.4 Minimum number of students required to run a particular course:
DE and IE/OE courses can run if the number of students registered in the course is equal or more than 5;
otherwise, the following will be adopted:</li><li>The course can run, however no teaching load will be counted for the CI/s and/or CC.</li><li>In order to count the teaching load for the CI/s and/or CC, an approval from the Dean (academics)
on recommendation from the DUGC is to be obtained in case running the course is indispensable
for the students registered in the course.
7.5 Course substitution
Course substitution policy, for the students who could not earn the credit/s by successfully completing
the course/s in earlier attempt/s, is as follows:
• No substitution is possible for the IC and DC courses.
• Department elective (DE) and open/institute elective (OE/IE) courses might be substituted by an-
other DE and OE courses, respectively.
7.6 Grade improvement
IIT Jammu provides the option of grade improvement as per the following policy:</li></ol><p>7 SPECIALTIES IN THE REGISTRATION
7.7 Relaxation</p><p>7.6.1 Grade improvement through additional learning
If an UG student has earned more credits and thus, completed more number of GPECs than the B.Tech.
degree requirements, a student can substitute, a maximum number of 2 elective courses for the improve-
ment in the grade. A DE or OE course can be substituted by another DE or OE course respectively. A
student has to make a request for such course substitution and the subsequent grade improvement at the
end of the completion of all the B.Tech. degree requirements.
7.6.2 Grade improvement through repeating a course
All of the following conditions are required to be satisfied for a student to repeat a course or several
courses for the improvement of the grade/s:</p><ol><li>Maximum 2 number of courses, during the entire B.Tech. programme, can be repeated for the
improvement of grades.</li><li>Maximum one attempt a student can get for the repetition of a particular course.</li><li>The student, if interested, has to repeat a course within next 2 semesters.</li><li>The student will be allowed to repeat a course in case the student has received a grade CD or DD
in the 1 st attempt.</li><li>Repetition of a course will be allowed provided the 2 nd attempt does not require overstay in IIT
beyond V III semester.</li><li>No course can be substituted for the improvement of the grade.
The latest grade, assigned in a course if repeated, will replace the previous grade in that particular course
and therefore, will be the final one. One should also notice that the attempt for the grade improvement
might deteriorate the CGPA also in case a grade with lower grade points is assigned in that course when
attempted 2 nd time.
7.7 Relaxation in the B.Tech. degree requirements:
The criterion of minimum credit requirement C min for the GPECs to obtain a B.Tech. degree can be
relaxed for a certain section of students under special circumstance. The student, who is interested for
the relaxation, needs to apply to the SUGB. A relaxation might be recommended by the SUGB under the
following circumstance:</li><li>The requirement, of completing 1 OE/DE of maximum 3 credits, might be relaxed provided a stu-
dent has completed 10 or more semesters, and all other credit requirements to obtain a B.Tech.
degree have already been earned.
7.8 Termination from the B.Tech. programme
In order to provide an alternative to choose an appropriate career option, a termination to academically
non-performing students is recommended.</li></ol><p>7 SPECIALTIES IN THE REGISTRATION</p><p>7.9 UG diploma</p><p>7.8.1 Criteria for the termination due to poor academic performance
A student will be terminated if total number of backlogs in GPECs ≥ 8.
7.8.2 Efforts to avoid a termination due to poor academic performance
To safeguard an academically non-performing student from impending termination, the following proce-
dure will be adopted:</p><ol><li>If total number of backlogs in GPECs ≥ 4, the student will be in warning phase.
Kindly notice that in this case, the student will go through the moderated course load because the
criteria mentioned in section 6.2 will get satisfied. It will also provide an indication that the student
needs to improve his/her academic performance.</li><li>If total number of backlogs in GPECs ≥ 6, the student will be in probation phase.</li><li>If total number of backlogs in GPECs ≥ 8, the student will be terminated as mentioned in sec-
tion 7.8.1.
Undertaking from the guardian/parents: A student, undergoing warning/probation phase, needs to
submit the undertakings from him/her-self and his/her guardian/parents in a prescribed format to register
for the courses in the next semester.
Possibility of appeal to the Senate: The student has the provision to appeal to the Senate for the rein-
statement of his/her studentship. However, without the approval from the Senate, the studentship of the
candidate will be treated as cancelled.
7.8.3 Termination due to semester drop without the SUGB approval
A student can also be terminated from the B.Tech. programme in case of a semester drop without the
SUGB approval as mentioned in section 5.6.
7.8.4 Termination due to other reasons
The other reasons for which a student can attract termination from the institute includes committing
an offence punishable under the Indian penal code, violation of rules and regulations prescribed by the
Indian constitution and any other mis-conduct, adopting academic and/or any other severe malpractice/s,
and gross violation of common rules and regulations of the institute, etc.
7.9 Inadequate performance for a B.Tech. degree and the provision for the diploma
In case, after the end of the XII semester, a student has earned equal or more than Z min credits from the
CECs, but the credits earned from the GPECs are lower than C min , the student might apply for an UG
diploma from IIT Jammu provided the following conditions are satisfied:</li></ol><p>8 DETERRENCE AGAINST ACADEMIC MALPRACTICES</p><ol start="3"><li>In case, the condition mentioned above in point 1 gets satisfied, but the condition mentioned in
point 2 does not get satisfied, the student will be eligible for an UG diploma in engineering.
8 Deterrence against academic malpractices
The act of academic malpractices will be dealt with by the CI/CC, DUGC and academic disciplining
committee (ADC) depending on the severity of the malpractice.
8.1 Committees and the punishment imposing capacity level</li><li>The maximum punishment of allotment of grade FW will be dealt by the CI/CC and/or DUGC.</li><li>More stringent disciplinary action will be handled by the ADC.
8.1.1 Constitution of DUGC
The constitution of the DUGC will be as per the guidelines provided in section 1.3. In case the department
offering the course and the department of the concerned student are not the same, the case will be dealt
with by the DUGC of the department offering the course. In that case, the Head of the department of the
student will be called for the discussion and information dissemination.
The presence of three faculty members of the DUGC are required to complete the quorum.
8.1.2 Constitution of ADC
The ADC will comprise of the following members:</li><li>Dean (academics): Chairperson</li><li>Associate Deans (academics) of UG and PG</li><li>Dean (student welfare)</li><li>Associate Dean (student affairs)</li><li>Associate Dean (hostel affairs)</li><li>A faculty member to be nominated by the Dean (academics)</li><li>Liaison officer SC/ST/OBC (if appropriate)</li><li>An women faculty member to be nominated by the Dean (academics) (if appropriate)</li><li>Academic student secretary</li><li>General student secretary</li><li>Student representatives of the SUGB
The presence of five faculty members are required to complete the quorum.
The concerned student, the CC/CI (if appropriate), the Head of the department offering the course (if ap-
propriate) and the Head of the department of the student will be called for the discussion and information
dissemination.</li></ol><p>8 DETERRENCE AGAINST ACADEMIC MALPRACTICES</p><p>8.2 Guidelines for students</p><p>8.2 Guidelines for students during examinations
All the students are advised to adhere to the following general guidelines during examinations:</p><ol><li>It is mandatory that a student should bring identity card issued to him/her by the institute during
all examinations. Inability to show the identity card when requested by the invigilator may lead to
expulsion from the examination hall/room and thus, the cancellation of the examination.</li><li>Students are strongly advised not to carry any electronic gadgets, like mobile phones, tablets, laptops
and programmable calculators, etc., inside the academic block. All such items should be kept at the
hostel securely so that no body else can misuse those during the examination. In case of misuse
of electronic gadgets, the owner of the gadgets will be held responsible unless anybody else is
found/proven to be guilty. In case any such electronic gadgets are found in possession or in the
belongings of a student during the examination even if the gadget is found to be turned off, it might
attract severe punishments as prescribed by the rules of the institute.</li><li>During the examinations, any kind of exchange among the students is strictly prohibited. Therefore,
the students are strongly advised to carry all the necessary and acceptable materials by own selves.</li><li>There should not be any scribblings on any part of the body, in any items used by the students or in
nearby furnitures and walls.</li><li>Any need of communication by a student should solely be addressed to the invigilators. Any other
communication in/out-side the examination hall/room or during the toilet break may attract disci-
plinary actions as per the rules of the institute.</li><li>It is the duty of the students to take permission from the invigilator to leave the examination
hall/room at the end of the examination and/or temporarily for any toilet break. If a student is found
to be outside the academic block while the examination is going on without the prior permission
from the invigilator, the examination of the student will be cancelled. In case a student completes an
examination before the stipulated time, the student should not get involved in any discussion before
the student leaves the academic block.</li><li>It is the duty of the students to ensure all fairness during the examinations. Any lapse, knowingly or
unknowingly, leading to academic malpractice might attract disciplinary actions.</li></ol><p>8.3 Flow of procedures and guidelines
After identifying any case of academic malpractice incurred by a student, the concerned invigilator must
convey the incident with a brief report (along with the seized document/s if any) to the academic office.
8.3.1 Guidelines for invigilators
In case it is observed that a student is using unauthorised materials like chits, lecture notes, books, phones,
answer papers of others, etc. during the examination, the invigilator should seize such items. In order to
confiscate the unauthorised materials from the students and keep the evidence of such malpractices,
invigilator might ask for help from the academic office when the needs be. The invigilator should seize
the answer booklet used by the student. The invigilator should issue a fresh booklet to the student so
that the student can resume writing the examination. A detailed report along with all the seized materials</p><p>8 DETERRENCE AGAINST ACADEMIC MALPRACTICES</p><p>8.3 Procedures</p><p>should be submitted by the invigilator to the academic office. Both the answer booklets should also
be submitted to the academic office Answer booklets will be handed over to the CC/CI in case it is
recommended by the DUGC or ADC. However, both the answer booklets can be given to the CC/CI
temporarily after the examination is over by the academic office, but both the booklets are to be returned
to the academic office by the CC/CI within a prefixed time mutually agreed.
In case, it is observed by the invigilator that the students are involved in verbal communications, answer
booklets of the participating students can be seized or marked by the invigilator to draw the attention of
the evaluators and necessary actions by the CC/CIs. In case the answer booklets are seized, the incident
has to be reported to the academic office.
In case, a part of the body of a student is found with scribblings, the incident should be reported and
endorsed by all the invigilators. In case there is a single invigilator in the examination hall/room, help
from academic office can be taken for the witness and second endorsement along with the endorsement
from the invigilator.
It is to be noticed that the CC/CI when doing the invigilation duty for the same course s/he is teaching,
the CC/CI will also be called as the invigilator.
Invigilators will, by default, consider lecture notes, books and any other similar items as unauthorised un-
less any particular materials have specifically been allowed by the CC/CI and informed to the invigilators
accordingly.
8.3.2 Guidelines for report preparation</p><ol><li><p>An act of malpractice during an examination is to be reported by the invigilator immediately, latest
within 24 hours.</p></li><li><p>Report must contain: Entry number, name of the student, course code and name.</p></li><li><p>Brief description of the event along with time and date</p></li><li><p>Collections of the evidence if any and submission of the same along with the report</p></li><li><p>Undertaking from the student if the student wants to appeal for leniency
8.3.3 Guidelines for the CC/CI
In case, a punishment is imposed to a student due to an act of academic malpractice, it should be reported
to the concerned student, the Head of the department of the student, the Head of the department offering
the course, Dean (academics) and the academic office.
The CC/CI, if wishes, might refer the case to the DUGC with specific recommendation.
8.3.4 Guidelines for the DUGC and /or the ADC</p></li><li><p>After receiving the report from the invigilator, the academic office will inform the CC/CI, DUGC
or ADC depending on the act of academic malpractice.</p></li><li><p>Date of meeting of DUGC/ADC: In case of academic malpractice during an examination and
it is reported to the DUGC/ADC, a meeting will be called on the following working day of the
last date of examination by the respective body. It is the duty of the concerned students and the
representatives to make themselves available for the meeting.</p></li><li><p>The concerned student along with the student representatives of the DUGC/SUGB will be invited
in the meeting.</p></li><li><p>In the case of DUGC, at-least 3 DUGC faculty members and in the case of ADC, five faculty
members of ADC are required to be present in the meeting to complete the quorum.</p></li><li><p>The CC/CI and the invigilator who submitted the complaint and the student against whom the com-
plaint was made will not be the part of the DUGC/ADC even if s/he happens to be a member of the
DUGC/ADC. In that case, another faculty member/student representative can be nominated by the
respective persons.</p></li><li><p>The recommendation of DUGC/ADC along with all the documents tabled during meeting will be
forwarded to the Dean (academics) for approval with a copy to all the faculty members involved in
the meeting.</p></li><li><p>The Dean (academics) may approve the recommendation, seek clarifications, or submit it to the
ADC/separate committee/Senate if a more stringent measure is warranted.</p></li><li><p>After approval by the Dean (academics), the report is sent to the academic office for implementa-
tion. A letter is also issued to the student regarding the implementation of the disciplinary actions
with copies to the concerned CC/CI, invigilator, the parents of the student, the Head of the depart-
ment of the student, and the DUGC/ADC members. The office of Dean (academics) should file all
documents related to reported cases of academic malpractices. It is expected that the decision of the
DUGC/ADC should be intimated to the all concerned latest by one day before the last date of grade
submission.</p></li><li><p>The office of Dean (academics) will be responsible to identify the repeat offenders. On discovery
of a case of repeat offence, the relevant documents are forwarded to the ADC. A repeat offence
means that the student has already been found guilty of a similar offence earlier; it need not be in
the same course, or even in the same department. In this situation, Dean (academics) may involve
or invite one psychological expert from the institute to be an associated member of the ADC during
the entire procedure after considering the gravity of the case.</p></li></ol><p>8.4 Disciplinary corrections
Depending on the severity of the act of academic malpractices, different corrective measures are recom-
mended.
8.4.1 Impersonation: Proxy in attendance/Leaving the class after giving attendance
Missing a class after marking attendance will lead to issue of warning letter to the student by the con-
cerned CC/CI. The second offence will lead to one grade penalty. Repeated offence beyond the second
time will lead to allotment of grade FW in that particular course.
In this case, the CC/CI is solely empowered to take the decision. The warning and punishments can be
conveyed by the CC/CI to the concerned student by an email notification with a copy to the batch of the
students.</p><p>8 DETERRENCE AGAINST ACADEMIC MALPRACTICES</p><p>8.4 Disciplinary corrections</p><p>8.4.2 Impersonation: Representation of a student during any evaluation

IIT Jammu, after a lot of deliberations considering the advantages as well as the dis-advantages associ-
ated with the change of department and because of its focus on interdisciplinary course curriculum,
has decided not to offer the change of department.
10 Awards and recognitions
It is the duty of IIT Jammu to recognise the efforts of the students who would strive hard to perform well
till the completion of the B.Tech. programme. It is also the duty of IIT Jammu to continue to encourage
the existing students of the institute.
IIT Jammu also has the reservation to award a student against whom a disciplinary action has already
been taken by the institute. Therefore, it is also implied that any award provided by the institute at any
previous occasions is liable to be cancelled in future if the needs be. In that case, all the certificates and
medals might also be seized from the student by the institute.
10.1 Certificate to encourage the existing students
To encourage the existing students, top three performers based on the CGPA, of every batch up to 3 rd
year level from every department will receive a certificate of encouragement provided the student did not
have any backlog course in any of the previous semesters and there is no record of disciplinary actions
against the student
In case of tie in CGPA up to two decimal places, all such students will receive the certificate.
10.2 Awards for the graduating students
The following medals are to be awarded to the graduating students if all the B.Tech. degree requirements
are satisfied:
10.2.1 President of India gold medal to the institute topper
A student with the highest CGPA, among all the graduating students of the institute, will be accorded
with the President of India gold medal provided the student did not have any backlog course in any of
the semesters and there is no record of disciplinary actions against the student.
In case, there are more than one graduating students with identical CGPA up-to two decimal places, the
student who has earned more credits will be the awardee of the medal under consideration.
In case, the tie still persists, the following criteria, with descending order of preference, will be followed
to select the awardee:</p><ol><li>The student having B.Tech. degree with minor will get the first priority under the present mode of
classification.</li><li>The student having B.Tech. degree with honours will get the next level of priority.</li><li>A committee might be constituted to break the tie and select the awardee if the tie still persists.</li></ol><p>11 CONCLUSION</p><p>10.2.2 J &amp; K bank gold medal to a graduating student based on overall performance
A graduating student, other than the awardee of the President of India gold medal, based on his/her
overall performance during the entire degree programme, will be accorded with J &amp; K bank gold medal
on recommendation of a competent committee.
10.2.3 Institute silver medals to the graduating students of every department
A student with the highest CGPA and who has secured honours with the B.Tech. degree, among all the
graduating students of the (major) department excluding the awardee of the President of India and J &amp; K
bank gold medals if any from the department, will be accorded with the institute silver medal. The similar
guidelines as mentioned in section 10.2.1 will be followed to select the awardee from every department.</p><p>11 Concluding advisory

All the B.Tech., M.Tech., Ph.D. and other degree awarding courses will be represented by 9 alphanumeric
characters with a certain combination, and the combination scheme is hereby termed as the course code
convention.
Kindly notice that the M.Tech. students and the Ph.D. scholars, in together, will be called as the post
graduate (PG) candidates.
In the course code convention, the 9 alphanumeric characters can be considered to be split into three
parts where every part will consist of 3 characters.
Unique code specific to a course: The combination of first and second parts of the course code conven-
tion will be unique one for every distinct course.
Level of a course: The third part of the course code convention will represent the level of the course.
This part might vary slightly time to time depending on the students targeted and restructur-
ing/adjustment of the course curriculum if any.
Unique code specific to a course:</p><ol><li>First part: The first part of the course code convention will consist of 3 letters and this part will
further be subdivided into the following two segments:
(a) The first segment will consist of 2 letters indicating the subject code as mentioned in table 7.
(b) The remaining segment will consist of a 1 letter indicating the type of teaching/learning scheme
adopted in that particular course as given in table 8.</li><li>Second part: The second part will consist of 3 numerical digits denoting the course number. The
course number might vary from 000-999 indicating unique number associated with a course, and it
will be assigned and maintained by the concerned department or the academic office depending on
the course and its connection with the curriculum.
Level of a course:</li><li>Third part: The third or remaining part of the course code convention will consist of 3 alphanu-
meric characters indicating the level of the course. The significance of each of the characters are as
follows:
(a) The first character (of the level denoting part of the course code convention) will be a letter
either between the U or P to indicate whether the course is mainly aimed for UG or PG
students, respectively.
(b) The second character (of the level denoting part of the course code convention) will be a numer-
ical digit indicating the batch/class of students for whom the course is primarily programmed
for.
(c) The third character (of the level denoting part of the course code convention) will be a let-
ter among the M , E, I or X to denote whether the course is core/mandatory, departmental
elective, open/institute elective, or it is a credit earning course, respectively.
